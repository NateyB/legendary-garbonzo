The latest Reviews from GameSpot For a game with so many strong personalities Battleborn somehow lacks a cohesive identity Every facet from the characters to the progression to the visual presentation feels overloaded with ideas some good some bad some just confusin The best example of Battleborn s deep seated identity crisis is its massive character roster Though technically a first person shooter the game s heroes utilize all sorts of preset weapons abilities and roles that pull from every influence imaginable There s a longbow wielding wood elf a penguin piloting a mech suit a cybernetically enhanced luchador the list goes on Impressively even characters that seem superficially similar inevitably offer something unique that makes their gameplay memorable and enjoyable be it a particularly powerful super or simply a higher than average movement speed This mechanical variety is not only remarkable it also drives Battleborn s longevity Where other game s dole out new tools or gear as you progress Battleborn builds these unlocks into entirely new characters You ll unlock new heroes steadily and without much conscious effort so you ll generally have one or two new options by the time you ve outgrown your current character Unfortunately you might outgrow them more quickly than you d expect Testing out a new hero for the first time can feel a bit overwhelming since some abilities specific requirements and effects aren t super apparent but as soon as you overcome this initial teething period each heroes gameplay loop starts to grow routine This is in part a symptom of Battleborn s approach to action its gameplay is fast and frantic but also light and loose Forgiving design choices like infinite sprint and ammo no fall damage and the ability to reload while sprinting encourage players to move and shoot rather than stop and think As a result I found I generally just had to spam the primary attack button trigger my special abilities whenever possible and occasionally retreat to let my shields recharge This is especially true during the cooperative campaign which consists of eight loosely connected missions that feel more like Destiny s Strikes than a carefully crafted narrative driven story mode Enemies are for the most part brainless and predictable cutting them down in droves can feel empowering but it also underscores the repetitive simplistic nature of the baseline combat It s also somewhat frustrating that all eight missions repeatedly remix the same three scenarios defend the asset escort the robot and kill the boss Thankfully you can read all about your character s abilities before diving in It s a bit tedious but definitely helpful Thanks to the variety of the characters and frenetic energy of the combat however Battleborn can still end up being a blast Sure the moment to moment gameplay feels superficial but when your five man squad is getting absolutely swarmed and you ve already sunk minutes into a mission and you ve run out of respawns the tension and chaos combine to form a powerful engine of fun Plus as you get deeper into the campaign a discernable difficulty arc emerges and helps give the whole affair some much needed momentum A word of warning though if you re playing alone you won t have much fun Without other players combat becomes a slog and certain objectives become nearly impossible But hey at least there s split screen co op and streamlined matchmaking Outside of the eight campaign missions Battleborn offers three competitive multiplayer modes and here the gameplay develops a slightly more strategic sheen Unlike the mindless fodder you fight in the campaign multiplayer pits heroes against heroes which forces you to approach combat more thoughtfully If you re playing a melee character for example charging directly at your opponents is suddenly way more dangerous so you re forced to seek advantageous positions and strike judiciously Healers and support characters also become more crucial team composition can occasionally turn a match s outcome into a forgone conclusion so choose wisely or suffer humiliation The modes themselves add an extra layer of strategy as well Meltdown for example requires both teams to guide minions to designated grinders The more robots reach the grinder the more points that team scores This and the somewhat similar Incursion mode borrow MOBA elements to create setups that emphasize objectives over kills In practice this equates to action that s less chaotic but far more involving than anything in the campaign and the combination of distinct characters and MOBA inspired objectives makes Battleborn s multiplayer feel genuinely fresh For some reason the characters you re introduced to first are also the characters you unlock last which feels odd This component is by no means flawless however The added strategic depth helps but doesn t eliminate the simplicity of the core gameplay but more importantly there s not quite enough content to make Battleborn feel totally substantial The three modes offer just two maps apiece and while that s not unusual for a MOBA it s awfully light for a shooter especially one with a relatively short unadorned campaign The game s also missing certain amenities like killcams and for some reason you can t simply vote on a new map when a match concludes Your team is automatically dissolved and you re booted to the home screen every time which is especially troubling given the game s team based nature There s also an issue with Battleborn s in match leveling system The game features several forms of experience and progression including individual character leveling unlockable gear and an overall Command rank but the most impactful system is the on the fly leveling that occurs within each mission and match another concept swiped from MOBAs In essence every character has a unique tier skill tree Each tier contains two mutually exclusive upgrades As players earn XP while playing they ll gradually work their up the tree until one skill at each tier is unlocked At the end of the match or mission the tree resets In the campaign this system works remarkably well I never felt hindered starting at zero but I was always glad to have all my fully leveled abilities back by the end Many of those upgrades only marginally improve the effectiveness of an existing ability but others tangibly impact the character s playstyle and all of them lend a sense of escalation to every mission In the competitive multiplayer however this system can unfairly stack the odds against players who actually need the most help The better you play the faster you re able to progress through the leveling tree which of course makes you even more powerful This generally isn t an issue in close matches but when a round starts to get away from you it can snowball into a lopsided thrashing that gets less and less fun for the losing side While it may not be as important as the progression system or multiplayer modes it s worth noting that Battleborn s writing is by and large excellent The humor can occasionally produce forced cringeworthy lines but far more often it s goofy witty and endearing with a distinct voice that should be immediately recognizable for Borderlands fans It won t appeal to everyone s tastes but anyone can appreciate the deep well of one liners that flavor both the campaign and surprisingly the competitive multiplayer And while there isn t much of a narrative to speak of the stylized cinematics that bookend the campaign are pretty spectacular Battleborn s strong Saturday morning cartoon vibes might actually be the game s single most defining aspect Outside of that consistent permeating voice the game feels like an elaborate patchwork of ideas that compete for attention without necessarily adding much to the experience The combat is frantic and tense but often feels samey and superficial The in match leveling works wonderfully in the campaign but can become problematic in multiplayer The varied cast of heroes adds longevity but the game still feels relatively content light With so many moving parts that never quite gel I found plenty of things to love but just as much to feel confused by and ambivalent about Chronos is a game about combat mastery Hostile encounters lead you through its world separated only by puzzles and moments of discovery Understanding your enemies and overcoming them is key to moving forward while death acts as the teacher that keeps you after class to discuss what you did wrong Some foes can prove highly difficult but learning their patterns and how they react to your actions turns such encounters from stilted and daunting to rhythmic and exhilarating Chronos could be accused of mimicking a number of different games but what it does with all it has makes for a highly enjoyable experience that stands on its own despite a few flaws A third person action adventure game Chronos puts you in control of an year old character and every time you die and respawn you age a year With aging comes changes to your character While you re young there s a bigger emphasis on your strength agility and vitality stats but that wanes as you grow older your arcane stat becomes more significant as your other three stats grow at a slower rate Starting at age you earn a trait every years that grants you a significant stat boost in either strength agility arcane or vitality Getting older is just as scary as it is in real life so staying alive feels paramount to staying strong and healthy thankfully it s not quite as dire as that since I felt like I needed to restart because I had gotten too old you don t lose any of the points you assign after leveling up VR lends an incredible sense of scale to Chronos world and enemies Your options in combat consist of attacking dodging and blocking Your weapon of choice should correspond to where you re putting your skill points if you use a sword you ll benefit from more agility while an axe will become more powerful with a higher strength stat It s unfortunate that there are more strength oriented weapons earlier in the game as I only got a chance to switch up my sword for a worthwhile weapon when I was deep into the second half of my playthrough Arcane is Chronos s form of magic though it acts less like what you d expect and more like a power attack However this isn t a bad thing as executing arcane infused attacks is incredibly satisfying When you get the first arcane stone it adds a little extra kick to your heavy attacks Additionally your attacks become infused with the arcane magic when you dodge at the right time further enhancing the satisfying rhythm of combat Puzzle solutions range from finding and combining the right items to spotting hidden points of interest in the environment The former works every time however the puzzles that require a keen eye can be a pain an early puzzle that required me to notice a relatively small detail had me stumped for quite a while The solution consisted of looking intently at something I wasn t yet able to interact with so I just brushed it off as something I would deal with later Eventually after going through every room and tinkering with every little thing a couple times I discovered the solution and was able to progress it was a frustrating bump in what was and would continue to be an engaging adventure The story revolves around three different worlds defeating three bosses and then slaying a dragon There s more to it and it even sort of explains why you age a year every time you die however it s all delivered through computer terminals books and other optional articles It s not the most exciting or interesting narrative and you won t feel lost or confused if you choose to ignore it the sparse narrative acts more as a world building device than anything else Chronos allows itself to be all about the combat puzzle solving and adventure Initially Chronos didn t strike me as something that would make much sense in virtual reality However as I played my mind was quickly changed Chronos made things you wouldn t even think about in a non VR game stand out in effective ways Gigantic enemies feel huge and made my palms sweat more than I d like to admit and there s a type of enemy that only moves when you don t look at it not your character you These seemingly small touches make a big impact when playing in VR Chronos is played at a fixed camera angle that shifts as you explore the world similar to classic Resident Evil games In one room you ll be positioned on top of a table while in the next you could be looking down on your character from a ceiling corner This method allows for great scene composition adding to Chronos already foreboding atmosphere in an awesome way One particular moment sets a creepy mood as you the viewer are put behind the bars of a prison cell watching your character move about on the other side This approach is a defining element of Chronos and it s a boon the majority of the time but it proves problematic on occasion when you have to judge the location of pitfalls from an ill fitting perspective Enemies can also get in your way and obstruct your view and while this is a rare occurrence it plagues your encounter with the last boss who s otherwise frustrating It s a disappointing bookend to what is otherwise a game filled with fantastic enemies and rewarding combat Chronos flaws are obvious but thankfully few and far between When you push your way through its more annoying aspects it welcomes you with enticingly grim set pieces and tense encounters It s a highly rewarding game that proves you can leverage VR to enhance traditional games but Chronos doesn t use it as a crutch it stands tall all on its own We receive the due reward of our deeds So reads the inscription on an artifact discovered in the early hours of Uncharted A Thief s End It s a passage from the Bible spoken by Saint Dismas a man crucified on the same day as J This anecdote sets the tone for a powerful game about loss betrayal regret and redemption In both its momentous set pieces and its intimate personal moments Uncharted drives its narrative forward with a rare understanding of its characters its world and the gameplay tying them all together It s a stunning combination of disparate parts It s a breathtaking marvel of a game By this point in the series developer Naughty Dog has led us across the globe in search of famous treasures from equally famous legends we unearthed El Dorado in the Amazon rainforest found the Cintamani Stone deep in the Himalayas and entered Iram of the Pillars a sandswept city with a religious history of its own In Uncharted however we find protagonist Nathan Drake leading a quiet life with freelance journalist Elena Fisher who happens to be his wife They live in New Orleans They have a three bedroom house They play video games together But this all changes with the return of Nathan s older brother Sam who was presumed dead for years Not only is he alive and well but he s fallen in with criminals and needs help paying a debt He also has a lead on one of history s greatest treasures the loot of the pirate Henry Avery which the brothers have sought since their early days of treasure hunting Now with Nathan forced out of his calm life they set off to chase their elusive white whale Elena and Nathan are leading a quiet life at the beginning of Uncharted Sam s arrival not only upends Nathan s newfound domestication but complicates his emotional life as well Uncharted gives us insight into his past and the way it shaped his psyche how he despises authority how he uses humor as a shield how he long ago accepted violence as a justifiable means to an end Uncharted tells this story with affection showing an expert attention to detail in the way Nathan s voice falters when discussing his childhood or how he stares at Elena when she s not looking These details are painfully human They bring the characters to life This nuanced take on Nathan s personality is reflected in Uncharted s gameplay too As with previous titles Uncharted revolves around third person combat climbing and puzzle solving But unlike its predecessors this game often lets you sneak past enemy soldiers without doing any harm at all This is a clear influence from The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog s darker take on a third person adventure Stealth requires a patient measured approach but it feeds into the idea of a more reserved Nathan Uncharted s action flows seamlessly alongside its narrative It s a fluid believable experience when it all comes together There are minor mechanical problems the cover mechanic can send you to the wrong obstacle or wall in the middle of firefights and rarely Nathan will grab the wrong ledge when climbing But these observations wash away within the grand scheme of things There s always something incredible around the corner to erase the momentary annoyances The game borrows from The Last of Us in terms of structure as well Much like its cousin Uncharted embraces a more open approach with much of its level design There are small sandboxes where you climb towers learn the layout mark enemies and choose to fight through them or circumvent the group in the interest of a quiet escape These areas would hurt the pace of a lesser game but Uncharted keeps tension alive even in its calculated moments transitioning from open areas to action sequences without halting the momentum Speaking of Uncharted s set pieces are the best in the series and among the best coordinated stunts in the medium There s a heist in Tuscany There s an acrobatic escape along the cliffs of Scotland There s a chase through a busy marketplace and it opens onto farmland as you leap between trucks slide through the mud and crash through shacks in the Madagascar countryside Just when you think Uncharted might settle into a steady rhythm it throws something new at you with high velocity and incredible power One of the game s massive puzzles These sequences give you agency but also enough guidance to maintain the euphoric rush of a car chase without constantly dying I m reminded of Half Life s escape from City where you sprint through apartments and over rooftops controlling your character while the game directs you without sacrificing tension in the process The key difference with Uncharted is how it directs you with its camera and lighting guiding you to the correct ledge or doorway or crumbling wall as you leap through explosions and plumes of smoke Audio cues also aid you characters shout over the din of gunfire telling you when to fight and when to keep running The dialogue makes sense within the moment And then there s the presentation of it all The cinematography both in game and during cutscenes amplifies the wonder of this gorgeous world It s not enough to call the jungles lush They re vibrant It s not enough to call the game s version of Scotland vast It s majestic There s also incredible animation at play and it sets a new watermark for games in the way it can illustrate subtle emotions like distrust and yearning Sweeping camera shots and intimate close ups tie the characters to the beautiful locales as Drake gazes toward mythical places he only dreamed of as a kid Uncharted doesn t root its visuals in the hues of realism but rather paints the world as it might look to someone intent on exploring every inch of it someone intoxicated by the prospect of adventure Uncharted s multiplayer though ditches grounded storytelling in favor of all out chaos Nathan Drake clones swing from grappling hooks Victor Sullivans pistol whip each other The villains of past Uncharted games lob grenades and fire RPGs and beat one another into a pulp This all plays out in multiplayer mode staples such as team deathmatch and zone control But  idols legends and myths How we pass down the ones that inspire us How an old photo of three friends sitting on a pile of gold can unleash a flood of memories Uncharted is a challenge to the medium In its writing in its design in its understanding of what makes games unique Uncharted is something to aspire to It s a shining example And we ll be talking about it for years to come How amazing that a turn based game can feel so urgent In invisible Inc I have as much time as I need to position my agents just so but I? m always paying attention to the security level at the top right of my screen That meter tells you when security will be heightened during your heist a It? s tense and challenging yes but Invisible Inc is also simple elegant and always logical It introduces new concepts in a slow drip giving you plenty of time to work out the details The titular spy agency is violently infiltrated initiating a time sensitive series of global heists and sneakabouts each of which you control from an isometric perspective in the style of strategy games like XCOM You begin with a duo but steadily add imprisoned agents to your roster as you spring them from holding cells Ultimately you take up to four agents on missions which typically involve obtaining sensitive data from a terminal grabbing ill gotten credits and hightailing it out of there Who needs trophies when stealthy success serves as its own reward Of course it? s rarely that simple There is the draw of credits for one which you spend on leveling up your agents? skills as well as on gadgets like weapons both ranged and melee augments implants that offer passive bonuses and other useful objects Ranged weapons don? t come with unlimited ammo they must be recharged with a one use charger when they go empty and agents you rescue don? t have weaponry on them Other mechanics further complicate your economic considerations needless to say credits are highly valuable and while you could engage in a straightforward infiltration safes and terminals lure you from one room to the next They have gravity and escaping it requires superhuman resolve But that pesky security meter is always climbing When it arrives at the next level security cameras that you hacked into might reset or additional guards may be deployed With every agent action you must weigh a number of possible consequences each of which is informed by multiple factors You order Agent Prism next to a door and peek through it to reveal a patrolling guard If she were closer you could predict the guard? s route for the next turn but that? s just not working out Do you open the door and risk alerting the guard so you can set up an ambush And what about that security camera in there Do you activate Agent Decker? s stealth rig and send him in knowing that the rig has a six turn cooldown or do you use your portable AI program Incognita to hack the security camera but use up all of your power resource in the process You need power to fire your weapons and hack terminals so this isn? t a decision to take lightly The game lets you adjust all sorts of variables before beginning a new campaign Here s a time attack variant Easier difficulty levels give you a limited number of chances to rewind a turn if you don? t care for the outcome and the easiest difficulty also lets you restart a mission if it goes awry albeit with a new procedurally generated layout Losing progress with a rewind or a restart feels like its own kind of failure and this negative reinforcement ensures that even easy mode can be stressful even when you know you can call backsies Should you lose any agents they? re gone from the current campaign for good unless you revive them with medigel This requires not only having the healing kit on hand but maneuvering another agent into a potentially disastrous situation Brilliantly however your downed agent may be taken alive by the mysterious enemy organization which leads to a jailbreak mission The captured agent may represent an acceptable loss you have a limited number of in game hours before the final mission is initiated Feel free to let Agent Decker languish in his cell you? ve got to think about the greater good if money and revenge can be considered the greater good anyway You might be more inclined to rescue a captured agent or to mourn her if she bleeds out during the heist if you? ve developed a connection with her Unit perma death is another mechanic that invites comparisons between Invisible Inc and XCOM but I was never attached to any given agent There? s a little flavor dialogue between agents here and there but it? s too brief and sporadic to engender any emotional response Central is married to her work The cool future visuals and angular character designs are decisively slick but the vaults and offices you infiltrate look more or less the same as you progress You know you? re in Australia or Brazil but there? s no audiovisual hook to remind you of the international stakes Strolling guards always mutter the same handful of bland responses when alerted and the tilesets don? t evoke the locale In Invisible Inc I regretted losing agents not because I mourned the loss of a comrade I? d trained and groomed but because I? d lost a flesh and bones tool from my toolbox Nonetheless this emotional distance is merely a minor issue I don? t care much about Invisible Inc s throwaway story and its last minute grasps at meaningful themes or about my agents? personal backgrounds Like the game my efforts are focused on getting the job done emotionally disengaged but intellectually centered I bask in the stylish cutscenes and the sharp voiceover but my attachment is not to the agency or its people but to the sheer pleasure of a successful heist At their heart adventure games are about delivering a narrative They re mechanically simple At their most complex they offer puzzles that give the player some agency in the world and slow their progression so they don t just blast through the narrative content This means that in order to be successful adventure games need to precisely execute on the few attributes they offer There isn t anywhere for developers to hide weakness or inexperience First person adventure games have received a lot of attention over the last couple of years Releases like Firewatch Gone Home Everybody? s Gone to the Rapture and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter deliver strong emotional narratives through high quality writing and environmental design with artfully crafted atmosphere The recently released P O L L E N or Pollen for short by Mindfield Games fails in this regard Retrofuturistic Pollen tells the story of a nameless protagonist sent to Saturn? s moon Titan to investigate a corporately controlled research base studying something called The Entity The game opens with you sitting in a dark room at a retro futuristic computer terminal A robotic voice asks you to answer a series of personality test questions each answer causing another row of pips to be added to a punch card produced by the computer The scene quickly establishes the corporation Rama Industries as large and powerful enough to ask entirely unreasonable things of its employees dressing the requests as boons or favors handed down to the lucky employee The introduction then moves to the interior of a lander craft on approach to Titan Over the intercom comes the voice of a Rama Industries representative from HQ reciting a well rehearsed schpiel detailing the mission Their tone artificially jovial at odds with the perilous activity of hurtling toward the ground After a successful landing you head to a nearby comms array in order to make contact with the ground team who seem surprised by the arrival As they begin to explain why the Rama rep s voice returns drowning out the details with extraneous mission parameters Immediately you re taught that something is amiss on Titan and this ominous obfuscation of the details cleverly makes you aware that Rama would prefer for you to remain in the dark Pollen? s atmospheric introduction sets the tone for the rest of the game beautifully but what follows fails to live up to its example From there you? re asked to explore the research base to investigate and uncover what? s really going on All exposition is delivered via audio logs cassette tapes found throughout the environment Audio logs are a tired expository method made even more frustrating in this instance by forcing the player to stand still next to immovable cassette players in order to listen to them Thankfully you can tweak that stick to speed up playbackYou don? t encounter any other humans during Pollen all exposition is delivered via disembodied voices This is a limitation that other games have used to great effect But in Pollen it feels counterproductive You quickly discover that The Entity is causing people at the research base to go insane and to kill themselves and or one another You only ever discover remnants of these encounters meaning that your level of patience and attention to detail will determine whether or not you fully comprehend what had happened Without ever witnessing the effects of The Entity first hand the impact of Pollen? s premise is greatly diminished Pollen? s primary interactive mechanic is an unexplained phenomenon which allows you to travel between two alternate versions of the research base You can leap forward into the future to sometime after the Entity? s effects have reduced the crew to a single mourning scientist This allows you to transition between timelines in order to solve traversal puzzles such as bypassing otherwise locked doors by moving into the dilapidated future or returning to the past to bypass debris This mechanic is a neat departure from simply traversing a static environment It s still clearly a linear experience but changing timelines provides the illusion of a more complex path An explanation of the how and why of the ability however is strangely absent As the game? s two to three hours wind on three separate methods for destroying The Entity are teased in audio logs The tools for enacting these methods are also provided but it seems none of them were viable No matter what was tried The Entity remained unperturbed Perhaps this was intended as a statement about the inevitability of the events that transpired or about the unknowable nature of The Entity Unfortunately it merely resulted in frustration The teased solutions are presented like foreshadowing but were little more than flavour Red green and blue keys acquired You may now enter THE STORY ZONE Pollen? s visual design is beautiful and the atmosphere it creates is strong but the game falls short when the narrative and storytelling method fail to give it substance The game ends with a bizarre minute cutscene which explains little Short games are wonderful when they leave the player something to ruminate on but they need to leave the player with something to ruminate on They can sometimes take on a poetic quality not in prose but rather in function a musing on the nature of some aspect of human experience Pollen seems to want to do this but is too vague in its delivery to be successful Like failed empires of the past I found myself caught in a hyperbolic debt spiral in Offworld Trading Company My Mars based colonial corporation had invested into energy production and one of my rivals detonated an EMP through my plants disabling them As the market for electricity boomed I had to purchase it at increasingly higher rates to keep my company afloat Within a few minutes I d gone from a solid AAA credit rating with negligible debt to a lousy D and millions in the red But hope wasn t lost Even as it seemed like my neo capitalist empire was on the brink of collapse I was plotting my comeback I bought up some land on prime locations taking care to keep them far apart so I couldn? t lose control of my critical buildings all at once Then I built some new geothermal plants the most efficient and productive energy producers available before employing hackers to jack up the price of power even higher Then I used a series of black market options including labor strikes and dynamite to disable the power plants of my competitors Soon I was the only supplier of power around and I was selling it for ten times what I d paid just a few minutes before My debt evaporated in seconds and I crippled my foes causing their stock prices to tumble I sold off some assets and bought my competitor s shares up And it was all over The campaign will have you investing in a series of colonies to maximize your weekly income in the hopes of building the first Martian monopoly Offworld Trading Company isn t like any other strategy game I ve played There s no combat There is only the free market You assume the role of a CEO of a new company eager to take advantage of the virgin Martian landscape and turn massive profits But you re far from the only company on the block Much like the colonial trading companies from the Age of Sail your aim is to outsell and out produce everyone else Stock and commodity prices are your tools and hostile corporate takeovers your strongest weapons In that sense Offworld works like a microcosm of real world economies Your first move is to pick a founding location and get to work organizing your supply lines From there you ll sort out which goods would be most productive to crank out given the situation at hand And just about everything factors into that decision If you found your company near good supplies of carbon but you need to send transports halfway across the map to access silicon you ll need a lot more fuel More fuel means you need more money to secure the same resources as another company and that cuts into your profits Even with only a smattering of basic resources water power carbon silicon iron and aluminum you ll find a complex web of interesting choices and decisions that you ll have to make on the fly A big piece of that is the black market While trading resources for profits would be great on its own Offworld mixes in some less than legal tactics that you and each of your competitors can bring to bear Whether it s destroying critical structures with dynamite everything is fair game except for your opponents headquarters or deploying an underground nuke to reduce resource yields for your competitors there are more than a dozen nefarious options for the unscrupulous trader As games progress the black market and its affiliated thugs become practical necessities Even if you can maintain your company without the aid of goons or pirates you won t be spared for long This is the price of unfettered competition and while it d be a frightening reality in this context it s a non stop stream of brinksmanship that encourages sophisticated and nuanced tactics Shady though it might be Offworld s black market system exponentially magnifies your strategic options making each round different from the last Every bit of text in the game is loaded with hilarious sardonic humor Playing off these options are a series of advanced buildings Most of your early structures are bare essentials farms water pumps mines etc But once you ve got your company going you can start developing patented advanced technology or create a bunker to house a cadre of hackers that can manipulate prices These bleeding edge structures are your proximal goal They boost your ability to stay competitive and give you an ever expanding field of options to leverage If you re losing goods because of piracy you can research more efficient ways to produce those resources If prices have tanked on Mars you can launch oxygen and food to eager consumers in the asteroid belts Once you start playing with these toys and blending their abilities with those offered by the black market games get cooking If you need to keep your hacking clandestine you can use an illegal hologram to disguise your programmers barracks Or you can disable or wrest control of a profitable Offworld Market to pull in some serious capital without having to invest in the expensive launches yourself If I had one complaint from this system it d be that when you pack eight players onto a map you ll have so much corporate reconnaissance and sabotage that it can be a bit tough to keep track of it all You ll have a news ticker in the bottom right that will try to keep you updated on who s been hit with what but it s not enough when things get crazy If you re overwhelmed though you can always tune the game speed down a bit to help you take control of the chaos so it s more of a nitpick than a foundational problem When all of these systems play together it s absolute magic There s a thrill in knowing that no matter what happens you always have a response Offworld gives its players an exceptional spread of options so that they can always think their way through a problem The questions then become can you think faster than your opponents and if so can you adapt as they shift their strategies to match your own Victory isn t simple or easy in Offworld but it s always satisfying Offworld is ruthless It is fast and it is brutal and with so many possibilities available at any time the game teeters on overwhelming This is saved at least in part by a stellar series of tutorials that introduce you to all of the game s major features It teaches you how to manage hostile takeovers how to protect your own stocks from buyouts how to combine the abilities of your buildings for maximum effect and how to plan your corporate campuses so they run at peak efficiency And it does all this with an acerbic wit that parodies hyper capitalistic figures of the s Item descriptions and character dialogue are a treat If you re a fan of apocalyptic tongue in cheek humor That penchant for cleverness runs through to the core The campaign does plenty of heavy lifting to acclimate new players to the game s complex gameplay It introduces you to some other core concepts switches up the victory conditions a bit and gives you a string of skirmishes that help you build a planet spanning oligopoly alongside your rivals This lets you test out some of the game s more complex tactics in a scenario that otherwise resembles a protracted multiplayer match stretched over a much longer period of time By the end you re well equipped to tackle ranked games and competitive play It s a splendid difficulty pitch that serves as the ideal introduction I had feared when I started that Offworld Trading Company would wear thin after a few games But that moment never came I still find every match exhilarating From the time I bought stock in my opponents sold them quickly to crash the price and then bought them out a few seconds later to the time when I managed to keep three launch pads going all at once to reach stupendous riches every game is memorable Each map is randomly generated and with four factions that have distinct strategies that all work with different resource distribution patterns even the opening is never quite the same Echoing the classic Civilization question of whether it s best to found your nascent country where your settler begins or to explore for better options you ll only be able to see certain parts of the map at fool hired hands into thinking you re just another employee toiling away in the opulent villa A keen eye or a finger on the button that triggers the x ray vision like Instinct mode will help you locate tools to unlock doors or items that take out enemies such as an exploding golf ball Hunting for opportunities in your environment is just as critical to the Hitman experience as the act of assassinating targets You spend most of your time sneaking and procuring said items and while you need to be ever vigilant to avoid detection from suspicious NPCs Hitman s unreliable AI can be easily fooled once you learn how to manipulate the way the game handles line of sight It s reasonable to expect that rounding a corner and making a sharp turn in an unexpected direction would throw off a hapless guard but it s a little silly that you can avoid detection by crouching and walking circles around objects despite Agent s head poking out in plain view Even though the enemies you circumvent aren t the brightest there are enough of them to make your job difficult once you infiltrate the mansion s perimeter Anyone who played the first episode will feel right at home and potentially more at ease despite staring danger in the face on a constant basis Whereas the mansion in Paris was brimming with people and stuffed with hallways and tiny rooms Sapienza s has more open space and fewer twists and turns This looser layout potentially presents fewer hiding places with no crowds to confuse guards and fewer windows to jump through but this also makes the moment to moment action feel more manageable That is until you see what lurks under your feet Some men just want to watch the world catch a cold The underground laboratory is a totally different beast compared to the mansion It s small and jam packed with professional security and doctors in a space that s only big enough for a few medical trailers and crates It s a scene that s tough to navigate and even harder to crack but its concentrated nature makes victory all the more rewarding With a swap of an outfit an errant keycard and a handy hazmat suit you can make it into the virus containment facility but it requires extreme patience any amount of aggressive behavior in the lab is met with extreme force Though you can still rely on Hitman s forgiving radar meets map which automatically tracks movements of targets and NPCs you can use infiltration and reconnaissance across the entirety of Sapienza to locate your targets on foot NPCs often engage in conversations that reveal the habits or locations of specific characters but you can also pursue mini objectives that lead you right into the lion s den such as playing the part of a target s golf instructor However it s not unusual to turn a corner and organically cross paths with your target However they have routines and once you realize your target is simply following a pre programmed path rather than living in and reacting to the world as a real person might their mystique takes a nose dive Indeed once you understand the movements of your targets the limitations of Hitman s enemy AI and the locations of critically useful items the sense of wonder and immersion fade and Hitman begins to feel more like a puzzle game This is most evident when you dive into escalation missions These multi stage missions come in five parts stacking new objectives with each round The added challenges like not pacifying NPCs make completing these challenges more difficult with each round but not necessarily more enjoyable as you already know how to complete the unchanging objectives It s possible to clear the first few stages of an escalation mission in a couple of minutes using the knowledge you gleaned from the episode s main mission and it doesn t take long to grow tired of walking the same paths and resorting to the same tactics You can look for new solutions but it s up to you to drum up the interest in doing so as the game doesn t go out of its way to mix up the variables and guide you in new directions Despite having a few distinct locations to explore within Sapienza your main mission won t last long but the variety is appreciated with the lab feeling different from the mansion feeling different than the streets In that regard this episode feels far more well rounded than the first The mediocre AI and animations return as does the need to repeat the same old spy tricks but they take a backseat this time around as Sapienza and its colorful denizens take center stage Episode two doesn t fill your plate but it s a satisfying experience nonetheless What We Deserve feels personal a narrative so steeped in familial heartbreak that it almost plays more like a visual stream of consciousness diary than a choose your own adventure zombie apocalypse story What started as a typical tale about how to survive the zombie apocalypse shifts in its final episode into a fascinating tale that asks the most relevant and important question of all why bother The fallout of the second episode is dealt with for sure and how to leverage that outcome in order to please Norma and the remnants of the shantytown Michonne helped ruin Once it? s figured out however Michonne is left as the only true adult in a house of abandoned children The time with them that follows can be played coldly but the cruelty of Michonne keeping distance from those in need given what she has and will envision doesn t feel right To take Michonne this far is to accept that the mother she was did not die with her daughters and more than the machete at her back this is what will keep her alive And so much of the first half of the episode goes with Michonne carefully preparing her unconventional family for the worst Aching mournful moments lie within a mother? s last letter having to explain to a child what happened to his father the decision to spend precious time to conduct a burial And yet it is all to the benefit of Michonne herself showing strength far beyond the ability to lop of zombie limbs An unconventional family but a family nonetheless It? s because of this that when the zombies do show up it? s almost incongruous The people add depth tension and terror all on their own The Walkers look increasingly boring in the face of the human drama that surrounds them Sure the action is kinetic and brutal as always and one particular death gets especially gross but the relevancy of these moments in the face of Michonne s layered story is diminished It? s a problem exacerbated by graphical hitches with faces disappearing and jitters during QTEs at points where precision is crucial issues that weren t apparent in the first two episodes This episode s strengths still lay in its human element The climax a prisoner exchange with Norma would be an anxious affair by itself with Michonne s actions potentially hinging on a massive bluff The scene becomes more impactful when you realize Norma s concerns mirror Michonne s albeit with Norma fighting for the sake of a far more awful person Telltale pulls off a minor miracle here keeping the villains just empathetic enough to second guess every action which raises the tension in this sequence even higher The real action occurs later as Michonne loses her grip on reality and flashbacks and hallucinations cloud her judgement at the worst possible time forcing a funhouse mirror redux of the reality shifting intro in Episode It? s hair raising in the moment and an example of excellent direction and planning Drastic times call for drastic measures With the miniseries now complete the game? s biggest flaw is in its structure At least a half hour shorter than the other two episodes What We Deserve nails the story Telltale has been tiptoeing around since first minute and it? s something that only begins to present itself towards the end of Episode before taking off here As a complete story Walking Dead Michonne is truly a story about family in a way few game narratives are Familial loss and the forced adoption of new members isn? t new for Walking Dead but in Michonne barring choosing to be cold during a moment of sorrow we have someone who finds power in parenthood instead of living in constant fear of it Her weakness is in having already failed at it It? s in finding out whether the weight of that failure should be allowed to break her or not Of course that? s the question that drives anyone stricken by loss It? s an easy question with hard answers and this is a game that doesn? t flinch from either Drinkbox Studios games all share a unique rather dark sense of humor and very distinctive artistic flare With Severed the studio has turned its attention to classic first person dungeon crawling and the result is a creative touch screen adventure with sharp colorful graphics that mask an in Severed places you in the role of Sasha Her home burned her family taken and her left arm severed she wakes up to find everything she loves destroyed When a mysterious and frightful vision bestows her with a living sword that sucks up power by severing limbs Sasha ventures forth into a nightmarish maze in search of a resolution While Severed is heavily influenced by classic dungeon crawlers it? s not exactly an RPG Sasha doesn? t have traditional stats that increase throughout the game Instead you use the body parts collected during combat and occasionally find strewn about the environment as currency to buy or upgrade abilities which include increased damage and health the ability to leech health from enemies or a longer window of time to sever limbs during combat to name a few Each new ability and piece of armor Sasha earns by killing a boss has its own upgrade tree so there? s a good amount of depth to the customization system overall If you prefer to rely on straightforward sword slashing you can focus heavily on that skill tree but there s plenty of room to experiment with Sasha s repertoire of equipment and abilities Fighting consists of swiping over enemies to attack or to parry incoming attacks in real time but within that basic framework Drinkbox has created a rewarding system where every move counts as you seek to collect body parts for new upgrades Monsters attacks are tied to a cooldown timer and you can successfully counter them by swiping toward an attacking appendage When done successfully this will open monsters up to consecutive attacks Facing a monster one on one is usually not a problem but Severed doesn? t make it that easy? the game frequently throws three or four monsters at you at once This means you have to keep a very close watch on the timer for each monster and shift your focus accordingly in order to attack and defend at the right time Timing is everything in Severed the only way to collect body parts is to fill your sever meter by consistently attacking without being blocked and by parrying incoming attacks Screwing up your timing or the angle of your swipe may lead to a blocked attack which in turn prevents your meter from filling up You may still win the fight but you will walk away empty handed Combat can quickly become a hectic even stressful affair Thankfully there are no random encounters here Severed lets you know where the monsters are with a glowing flame in the room ahead There? s also no real penalty to dying in the normal difficulty level Severed s map bears more than a passing resemblance to Metroid style games The overall world is quite large but the meat of the game is figuring out how to reach new tucked away areas Much like Metroid this is usually done by defeating a boss and earning a new ability Sasha can learn how to change the land from day to night and back again to open special doors for instance Sasha must cross hellish landscapes during her journey but even at its most sinister Severed sneaks in brilliant splashes of color This is a world that takes you through spooky forests forgotten temples fiery wastelands and more in Sasha? s quest to find her family The landscapes are equally dreamlike and nightmarish with bizarre plant growths and areas defined by isolation and ruin There? s an intriguing use of organic shapes and objects throughout A giant skull might be resting along a forest path and within the dungeons the actual doors are frequently living creatures? scary toothsome maws that open when given the right object At one point  your forces during an ambush no rare or unique resources to exploit nor any obstacles to slow down foes Every unit and building works the same regardless of placement on the map and as you build out a network of resource nodes you ll see the same desolate brown textures again and again Ashes of the Singularity does a great job of communicating the massive scale of its conflicts The early game doesn t have a lot for you to do or manage You have the ability to organize your legions into armies which are supposed to be super charged control groups And this works but only to a point Forming armies reduced the need to constantly micromanage units allowing me to focus on the larger plan pinching off enemy supplies flanking with the brutality of my dreadnoughts and dropping strategic weapons of mass destruction But Ashes of the Singularity still left me with scant few options to conduct my campaign It s hard not to draw comparisons to earlier massive scope strategy games namely Supreme Commander The parallels between the two run deep and cover everything from their approach to resource collection to their emphasis on massive battles But despite being a decade old Supreme Commander still wears the crown Rather than rest on the spectacle of massive battles alone it crucially wove finer pieces into its formula to make those bouts interesting Ashes of the Singularity doesn t have these flourishes what you see is what you get There is one note to this song and while beautiful in its own right is ultimately shallow It s a wonder to see in action but tedious to play Scale should be a canvas for battles not a replacement for a deep set of tools Instead of providing an intricate network of systems to work with Ashes of the Singularity cuts itself down leaving only the most basic elements of the genre intact You have a handful of units three resources and a basic goal At no point can you leverage anything beyond those basic pieces in a meaningful way Without more resources nuanced mechanics or a charming aesthetic to help carry the experience Ashes of the Singularity struggles to hold your attention As it stands Ashes of the Singularity feels like little more than a tech demo of Stardock s new Oxide engine At best it demonstrates the power of multicore optimization and DirectX being the latest game to push the limits of computing to render a massive number of moving parts in a burgeoning war machine Even so the game comes off as half finished There is a decent foundation but Ashes fails to build on it in a satisfying way The post apocalypse is often depicted as a barren almost desert like place where broken down buildings and abandoned towns litter the land The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human flips this concept on its head and depicts a post apocalyptic Earth covered in water long after the demise of humanity You pilot a harpoon equipped submarine through a vast ocean teeming with violent wildlife But exploring does more than bridge the gap between each fight as there are places to discover upgrades to collect and bits of story to piece together The world s mystery and its measured access make the exploration thoroughly enjoyable The ocean s settings range from lively fish inhabited areas to the polluted waters of the aptly named Pipe Central Music plays a big part in defining the atmosphere aptly accenting the mood of each location The bright and delightful Seaweed Forest is accompanied by happy music that ignites a sense of wonder while the dark ambient noise of The Abyss instills the feeling that something big is lurking in the shadows The mostly peaceful exploration contrasts the high stress intense battles with the game s bosses These fights can be difficult though they rarely feel unfair and you can always leave and go somewhere else if you re having too much trouble dealing with one Success requires concentration and carefully timed attacks Forge ahead with too much zeal and an enemy can easily catch you off guard killing you in one swift motion The boss battles themselves can be as simple as shoot a bunch of harpoons into them at the right time but a couple have more varied solutions some even have hidden exploits that can help turn the tables in your favor Triumphing over the game s challenging bosses grants a feeling of immense satisfaction your reward for patient measured play After finishing the main story you get a second chance to face off against bosses in Boss Rush mode It puts you back into battle with a completely fresh submarine sans submarine upgrades but you earn one back for every successful encounter After playing through the game with a fully upgraded ship taking on Boss Rush is a thrilling undertaking You re more adept at the game than you were when you faced each boss the first time but you have significantly fewer tools and abilities The scale of bosses and objects that litter the deep does a great job of communicating how small you are in this huge oceanic world And the way the ocean life moves makes creatures like whales jellyfish and bosses stand out beautifully against their sleepy surroundings Unfortunately the game s pixel art doesn t always look fantastic It can sometimes look a little muddy and the player controlled ship lacks definition compared to the rest of the world an issue that occasionally led to cheap deaths All the creatures you encounter and defeat are added to your creature log an encyclopedia filled with musings from the unnamed last human Like the audio tapes you also find during your journey these entries are written exceptionally well and add an appreciable amount of personality to the game Some of the logs mirrored how I felt when firing harpoons into superior yet innocent beasts It s a place I m happy the game takes you to as it organically makes you wonder whether the Earth would be in a better place if humans were out of the picture That said you don t need to ask yourself any thought provoking questions to enjoy The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human Its story and themes are delivered well but they don t come off as pretentious or preachy The challenging boss battles deliver immense satisfaction and the breaks of tranquil exploration offer delightful moments of discovery The Aquatic Adventure s ocean can be a dark and scary place but it s also undeniably alluring Even for those intimately familiar with the series Star Fox Zero is immediately confusing On the surface it appears to be a modern extension of Star Fox the space combat classic that took off in It certainly looks the part with its Wii U facelift but after finishing a single level It s not surprising to see Star Fox s mechanics change in light of the GamePad but where Nintendo strives to give you more control over your weapons it simultaneously neglects the chance to create a proper Star Fox sequel aiming for a retelling instead Zero is often a near mirror image of Star Fox featuring many of the same antagonists locations and one liners You lead the familiar band of do good anthropomorphic animals zipping around in nimble fighter jets thwarting intergalactic villains and indulging in campy yet catchy banter More than anything else in Zero piloting your Arwing is a joy Your booster jet communicates a great sense of speed as you twist in midair and flip around behind enemies leaving bursts of energy in your wake You also have to contend with tight spaces tipping your wings at just the right angle to slip through small gaps and avoid environmental perils As you bob weave and barrel roll your way to the heart of your enemies operations there are power ups and other collectibles to acquire along the way but they require a keen eye and quick reflexes You spend most of your time in the cockpit of your Arwing but Zero has a few new tricks up its sleeve when it comes to vehicles The first is the Walker which is a chicken like bipedal mech that you use to fight on the ground and within the confines of interior spaces It s actually a transformation of the Arwing which you activate on the fly with the press of a button The Walker can sprint hover and dodge at a moment s notice It s useful in a pinch but it doesn t hold a candle to the Arwing You also have access to a slow drone like copter in the Gyrowing It packs a tiny tethered robot that you can lower and navigate through small spaces to access computer terminals Once lowered you look through the robot s eyes using the GamePad s screen to pinpoint your target and hack away a process that s more tedious than anything else The Landmaster tank from Star Fox makes its return as well It trundles across rocky terrain with ease and can quickly roll or hover to avoid danger But new to Zero is the ability to transform the Landmaster into a jet It doesn t match the speed or maneuverability of the Arwing but it s a welcome bonus that makes piloting a slow tank a tad more exciting Most stages in Zero are on rails where you move forward at a constant rate In other scenarios typically boss fights you switch into All Range Mode and take full control of your Arwing In the on rails missions you re encouraged to attack enemies and destroy objects to clear a path but the game doesn t wait for you to do so because levels constantly pull you forward In All Range mode your objectives are focused on combat and it s here where Zero s complicated control scheme becomes the center of attention but not in a good way In past Star Fox games movement and aiming were directly connected you steered your Arwing to move your reticle Now you move your GamePad to adjust your aim independently from your craft In theory this allows you to be a more capable marksman picking off enemies with greater speed and accuracy than before The catch is that you have to look away from your TV and focus on the GamePad s first person cockpit view while your vehicle flies unattended You have the option to press a button to shift the cockpit view to the TV but even so the same disconnect applies Though you may find some success aiming with the third person reticle when flying through linear stages it s terribly misleading Rather than indicate where your shot will land the reticle in Zero s third person view is representative of your line of sight from the cockpit You can hold a button to disable motion controls when you aren t firing and in theory aim in the traditional Star Fox way but given the inaccuracy of the reticle this is hardly a saving grace This disconnect is frustrating in practice and feels like a passive aggressive nudge to look at the GamePad despite the fact that you have obstacles in your flight path and incoming fire to worry about So you learn to trust your instincts and tilt the GamePad to adjust your aim during on rails missions It s not ideal but it works most of the time Once you enter All Range mode you have no choice but to switch between first and third person perspectives Here the camera becomes unshackled and floats around your vehicle rather than directly behind it your over the shoulder line of sight is stripped away Although you can lock onto enemies that come into view it s only the camera that s affected not your aim This overall shift in perspective is jarring and it s difficult to find your bearings the first few times you have to deal with it not knowing where to look or what actions to prioritize It took hours to become fully acclimated to Zero s new rules but it eventually clicked While I still resort to feeling out my aim during linear levels I m more comfortable and effective in All Range mode now that I understand the order of operations position your vehicle appropriately focus on attacking your enemy until they re out of view then reorient yourself and start the process over The high learning curve was enough to make me put down the controller and walk away more than once early on but every time I returned my skills improved My relationship with Zero got off to a rocky start but I was in a better place once I convinced myself to forget everything Star Fox taught me and accept Zero on its own terms Even though I learned how to cope with Zero s peculiarities I found myself wavering between excitement and apathy as I went through the campaign Zero s new controls work and serve the purpose of giving you more precise control over your two primary functions but they don t necessarily make for a more fun space combat game Zero s more plodding missions feel like chores No matter how you slice it Star Fox has always been a series about flight and movement and Zero dilutes that formula by forcing you to prioritize shooting That s not to say you never had to fire at enemies in the past but the act of aiming was tied to movement which maintained the ever present joy of flight Now the act is tied to a complex control scheme that s a mild but regular source of frustration Zero was enjoyable at times despite its misgivings with the controls It s saved in part by its presentation which is simple yet eye catching from the start Blue skies and verdant hills with crimson enemies give way to vast expanses of outer space the perfect canvas for lasers and radiant stars With the added gravitas from the soundtrack and the quips from your allies during battle Zero often echoes the Star Wars films great battles albeit with a cast of furry heroes However when presented with so many familiar locations it was hard not to consider this as a missed opportunity to develop a totally original Star Fox sequel But the old material is handled with care and later levels stand out with new mission designs and set pieces featuring impressive scale By the end of my first playthrough I was eager to go back and retry old levels in part because I wanted to put my newfound skills to the test but also because Zero s campaign features branching paths that lead to new locations Identifying how to open these alternate paths requires keen awareness of your surroundings during certain levels which becomes easier to manage after you come to grips with Zero s controls My second run was more enjoyable than the first and solidified my appreciation for the game While I don t like the new control scheme it s a small price to pay to hop into the seat of an Arwing Though I feel like I ve seen most of this adventure before Zero is a good looking homage with some new locations to find and challenges to overcome It doesn t supplant Star Fox but it does its legacy justice The Banner Saga begins at ? Chapter ? and ends just as its engrossing plot begins to reach a tipping point It feels like the central portion of an epic novel torn straight from the binding It? s a game that looks and feels practically identical to its predecessor released two years prior but the attractiveness of its presentation inspired by ? s Disney style animation and the refined combat system still stand strong giving it an air of timelessness The Banner Saga presents a grand mythological odyssey and effectively conveys the hardships of the characters enduring it However this is not the ideal point to enter the series The Banner Saga ? s mechanics its layers of consequential decision making strategic management and tactical turn based combat are enjoyable within the confined context of this sequel but the narrative events of The Banner Saga are intertwined with its mechanical decisions Many plot developments and branching commitments one of which players may have to make before the game even begins are made more potent and morally complex with knowledge of events from the first game in the series The Banner Saga allows you to import a completed save file from The Banner Saga bringing with it a cast of characters who you may or may not have helped survive the ordeals of the first game These characters maintain their level growth statistical upgrades and all items you may have collected But in some cases the returning cast can be more than playable characters and I very quickly found a desire to revisit the original game to better orient myself The game paints a mythological Norse world of humans horned giants called Varl stone oppressors called Dredge and the factions within them But aside from a new centaur race the Horseborn the game doesn? t take time to introduce them as gradually as the previous did These omissions help keep the sequel? s pace moving quickly but although the game does have some tools to try and help initiate newcomers and refresh returning players on key narrative events a recap video and brief summaries of characters as they re enter the story they are short and feel insufficient Where the first Banner Saga focussed on preparing for war the fatigue it has on society and the pitfalls of leadership the second deals with fleeing from devastation as refugees and the dilemma of selfishly protecting your tribe versus working for the greater good during that journey As the leader of a caravan you slowly shepard hundreds of followers across the continent to what you hope will be safety Thankfully the game? s mechanics which can determine whether characters live or die permanently are relatively straightforward in operation Managing the followers in your caravan is simple but requires thought and diligence choosing to train enough fighters to defend your clan during conflict is important but so is having enough regular clansmen to gather food in order to keep everyone alive and if possible in good spirits Keeping morale high within your clan is advantageous as it adds fuel to the game? s Willpower resource utilised in the tactical turn based battles Points of willpower are spent to move characters beyond their natural range on the isometric battlefield add more points of damage to attacks and to activate and buff unique character abilities of which there are many Willpower along with the rest of the core combat mechanics remain unchanged from the original Banner Saga All units have distinct armor and health numbers and the amount of health one has directly correlates to how much damage they may be able to inflict The amount of armor one has meanwhile will directly block that amount of damage and units may choose to strike blows at either attribute The system is clear and uncomplicated but there are enough strategic variables present to make the deliberation process enjoyable The low value numbers along with a clear user interface allow you to make calculations and purposeful decisions quickly Whittling down the health of an enemy is always a desired move but attempting to attack a foe whose armor number is higher than your unit? s strength can risk negating all damage Choosing to chip away at the armor of an enemy can open them up to more effective attacks later on but leaving their health high means they? re a harder hitting opponent There is no way for units to heal and regain health which results in combat scenarios that can fluctuate wildly between cautious brinkmanship and invigoratingly aggressive maneuvers The Banner Saga? s combat also places a vital emphasis on unit positioning Large units such as the enormous Varl characters in your clan take up four isometric squares rather than one They are less mobile and their mass can cause blockages in the map stopping other melee units from reaching the front lines if the player assigned turn order is mismanaged But this can also be used to your advantage keeping enemies from reaching fragile ranged units Nearly all of the unique character abilities require considerations in positioning and turn order to be used effectively A passive buff from the new Poet class may grant extra Willpower to allies who witness a kill but only if the character is close enough to see it himself and sing about it The new Horseborn race may be able to Mule Kick a unit back several squares and damage all units it passes through but this effect can hurt nearby allies as easily as it hurts enemies The Banner Saga also introduces destructible barricades which can allow for interesting strategies but these only appear occasionally However in a system where positioning is so important there can be some annoyances that hinder combat stemming from the game? s lush D visual style Foreground elements of the otherwise stunning battlefield art mean that a tree branch can occasionally obscure an important portion of the map no matter how you pan the camera The units themselves can also cover elements of the battlefield Because the angle of perspective cannot be rotated a group of units clumped together can block sight of enemy traps which may cause damage or spawn more enemies if overlooked Minor irritations aside battles are still fair and challenging Primary characters have a higher level cap than the original game and are able to learn additional abilities The difficulty of The Banner Saga feels like a natural growth that bridges the two titles to accommodate these changes The continued challenge makes each maneuver important to consider and means that encounters can be lost as easily as they are won This is especially key to the enjoyment of The Banner Saga because losing a conflict doesn? t mean the game is over Losing may mean morale and clansmen are lost characters are injured and require several days of rest but these consequences can inform events in the story a story which will continue regardless of your actions Likewise story events and decisions made in the strategic management layer can have a rippling effect to other portions of the game so each must be carefully considered in context Dumping food supplies may save lives or create extra barricades for an imminent tactical encounter A poorly handled dispute may force you to fight and kill a party member you? ve invested a significant amount of resources upgrading Do you sacrifice lives food morale or political relationships When do you halt your journey to let your people rest and when do you press an advantage with an iron fist Situations are often fragile The way each layer of the game feeds into and informs the other creates a cerebrally and emotionally grueling loop that can take its toll on you as a player But it also helps engross you in the fate of the dire war torn world of The Banner Saga and empathize with the perils of a fleeing population and the characters that struggle to lead them The majestic hand drawn art and eloquent animations of units on the battlefield further amplify this feeling as does Austin Wintory? s stirring orchestral soundtrack with Gregorian chants haunting and illuminating the malaise of the world and events that occur The Banner Saga ? s wonderful balance of systems and their effectiveness in heightening the ongoing narrative can still be appreciated if you aren? t familiar with what came before but much more so if you are Like the original game The Banner Saga leaves you holding your breath completely invested in the world its inhabitants and their struggles anxiously eager for more There was a time before Doom when the term ? shooter? meant something entirely different scrolling spaceship games where blasting everything in sight was the only goal It? s an ideal format for cooperative multiplayer games yet seldom actually used Dead Star however jumps headlong into old school space combat to create a multiplayer focused game that works amazingly well After warring factions decimate most life in the universe a new era of peace emerges Dead Star focuses on the prison system where those who dare to defy this peace are thrown without hope of reprieve Underneath the burning red light of a dying star and policed by an AI warden who destroys any ships that try to leave this barren landscape is filled with resources old ship carcasses and asteroids Dead Star controls much like a twin stick shooter but with a lot more limitations Unlike most pure arcade style shooters weapon range heavily impacts strategy You? ll start off in a weak underpowered ship with incredibly limited firing range which keeps you focused on close quarters combat It? s a wise move especially during crowded battles when rampant cross fire can lead to mass frustration Between the limited range and power consumption of the many weapon system options Dead Star manages to become much more tactical in nature than a a capital ship enters a Conquest match the focus suddenly turns from the two teams killing each other to both teams aligning to destroy the capital ship as it slowly moves through the sector The four person team onboard the big ship must exit the ship and defend it against the Conquest teams This three way fight is one of the most interesting and creative multiplayer modes we? ve seen in a long time and makes the overall game far more involving as a result The view looks great from here Completing an Escape Run successfully also leads to rare items and rewards unavailable in the standard Conquest mode Unfortunately Dead Star only features these two modes and feels a bit light as a result There were also some noticeable issues with in game lag resulting in ships suddenly jumping around It was a fairly minor issue overall but enough to be annoying Dead Star overall is a fun change of pace from other multiplayer only games It comes with a decent tutorial and bot match options as well but the fast and fun on matches are the obvious draw The Escape Run mode is an intense and creative twist that keeps things lively For fans of old school shooters this is especially worth checking out When Stranger of Sword City starts you are the only surviving passenger from a plane that left Japan and somehow ended up crashing into another dimension a ruined purgatorial wasteland strewn with the remnants of our world It? s an apt setup for a game that finds itself helplessly trapped between worlds It? s too obtuse too lackadaisical about its plot to hold your interest and too threadbare to offer worthwhile depth It? s a game fundamentally trying to be different but trips up trying to fit any of its innovations onto the basic framework That framework is a rudimentary first person turn based dungeon crawler a style that seldom appears in the modern age You and a team of up to five other warriors set out to kill the world? s most dangerous monsters known as Lineage Types in order to collect special crystals formed from their blood Those crystals can in turn be given to one of the three main factions for power glory and hopefully a way home You accomplish this by wandering a crudely rendered D grid based labyrinth looting treasure chests and picking fights with painterly cardboard cutouts There? s no elaborate summon animations or spellcasting here Hits from the game? s varied assortment of blades wands and throwing weapons are displayed as chintzy slashes and flashes onscreen It? s all very much in keeping with the retro styling but for an RPG trying to prove its worth in it makes the game appear noticeably shabby An American Tale Fievel Goes To SpartaStranger of Sword City tries to make up for that with its layered character customization system You can select the look of team members from an assortment of dozens of beautiful anime inspired portraits as well as assign a class stats a race and an age which determines how your character gains experience points Your job and race has some influence on your starting stats and skills Fighters have high strength wizards and clerics high magic different races grant a single inherent skill such as being able to see and disable dungeon traps Once you get to the first hub city you have the option to create your own crew with varying traits and in theory the necessary skills to tackle any challenge that crosses your path In practice the dungeons are set up in such a way that no matter your assortment of abilities you? re rarely in a place of equal footing with the game Enemy stats in any one dungeon can vary wildly you could have a fight against four enemies that lasts seconds and three steps later have a battle with two higher level enemies that drags on for upwards of minutes Magic typically deals more damage than just slashing away ad nauseum but magic points are scarce and items allowing you to recover it are rare and expensive A wizard or cleric who runs out is essentially useless and it? s usually better to run back to home base to recover than risk fighting on with depleted resources This leads to a lot of grinding and backtracking which might also be acceptable if the game wasn? t painfully stingy with experience points even with the more arduous fights that one might come across Better weaponry and gear can help There? s a blacksmith in the hub world who sells weapons and items but these tend to be prohibitively expensive and most of his wares offer only nominal improvements to what you? re already carrying There is an interesting alternative however One of the smarter mechanics in the game is an ambush system where you can spend a special pool of ability points called Divinity to become invisible in specific spawn locations in each dungeon and wait for high level enemies to show up When they do killing them nets quite a bit of XP and offers a chance at a special chest full of decent gear but only if you? re able to kill the leader of the pack before he decides to run off Which taking into account your general underpowered nature even in later hours of the game is a rare occurance Inevitably even if you take the time to level up several times before walking into a new dungeon you will run into either a new trap a new obstacle or a super powered hard hitting enemy out of nowhere that kills characters in one or two hits Next you ll be subjected to the game? s least welcome dalliance with current trends permadeath Each character has a certain number of lives determined by the character? s age the trade off is characters with fewer lives gain experience abilities much faster When a character? s life is lost they can be taken back to home base to recover which in itself can take hours unless you have a rare item which can resurrect them immediately Even then the user interface for character management and recovery is clunky and the process is poorly explained Once the character? s final life is up though they are gone Unless you? ve put serious time into having a backup character to replace them you? re stuck grinding again Combined with everything else slow and grueling about Stranger of Sword City permadeath becomes the final straw The Looting DeadThese are all problems that could be forgiven in the face of a compelling reason to fight of which the game has few There? s fertile narrative ground in the game? s core premise even if more than a little reminiscent of J J Abrams? Lost The people from our world are stranded in this strange dimension but gifted with powers and set out to slay the monsters with the hope that with enough power they can discover a way home With the exception of one particular fascinating character a dying child in a mech suit living in a shipwrecked ocean liner most of the story is draped into interminably boring anime tropes and with permadeath as a core concept the game doesn? t even bother dishing out much in the way of dialogue or backstory You? re playing as interchangeable cannon fodder There? s something to be said for the continuing efforts to keep turn based RPGs viable and Stranger of Sword City in particular shows a commendable willingness to at least try fusing new ideas with still viable concepts of old However without characters even worth caring about to drive it along Stranger of Sword City is left leaning on its gameplay which is comprised primarily of the most laborious antiquated aspects of the genre What ambition it has can be found better implemented elsewhere More than years after Bioware? s original Baldur? s Gate set a new standard for Dungeons amp Dragons role playing games on the PC developer Beamdog has released an all new chapter in the Bhaalspawn saga dubbed Siege of Dragonspe One of the best aspects of Siege of Dragonspear is how it picks up right where Baldur? s Gate left off and fills in the gaps between it and its even bigge Baldur? s Gate II Shadows of Amn Just weeks have passed since you slew Sarevok and accepted your identity as a child of Bhaal the slain God of Murder when a new threat arises A woman with a divine connection named Caelar Argent is leading a crusade across the Sword Coast region with the insane but well intentioned objective of freeing souls unfairly dragged into Hell by devils The one problem with this plan is that it seems impossible It? s also resulting in the deaths of thousands as the army of this so called ? Shining Lady? rampages across the land You are pulled into the conflict as both the now legendary Hero of Baldur? s Gate and as the object of Caelar? s attention The overall story arc is a tad linear in that you progress fairly relentlessly from one location to the next en route to the titular siege of the crusade? s stronghold at Dragonspear Castle Unlike the earlier Baldur? s Gate games the maps here are a little smaller with less territory to explore but with more detail and points of interest crammed into these spaces Dragonspear emphasizes a steady and militaristic march forward instead of the adventure of discovery that was a main point of the old games It actually makes for a nice change of pace and adds focus to the whole story although one drawback is that you cannot retrace your steps after certain points which can make some side quests impossible to finish My one real complaint here came at the end of the game Things got a little pushy near the conclusion In the final rush to Dragonspear the plot presents you with choices that are really non existent as making the wrong call gets you into impossible battles with massive numbers of enemies And even worse the game seems to lock your party down and even prevent the ability to rest at all while storming the castle This caused a real problem with me because accepting the start of the final showdown resulted in me being stuck with a five member party through the most difficult parts of the game And speaking of massive numbers of enemies this is another dramatic change from the old Baldur? s Gate series While Siege of Dragonspear still uses the Infinity Engine that Bioware created in the late s with some noteworthy visual enhancements the game has been upgraded to make it possible to display dozens if not hundreds of characters on screen at the same time Combat here often features mob scenes of opponents New in game cutscenes feature Caelar addressing huge crowds of followers too and the actual assault on her castle near the end of the game is one of the most ambitious battles in the entire Baldur? s Gate franchise All of this is pulled off without a single framerate hitch or slowdown Another high point is the audio which again includes the superb score of the original game that stands up to any Hollywood movie soundtrack and a wide range of atmospheric effects to ramp up the impact of everything from pitched combat to wandering in the woods at night Antagonist Caelar is an intriguing anti hero that made me wonder if I was actually playing the bad guy at times Much of what she said made a fair bit of sense although there was always a whiff of brimstone around her that kept me convinced that she needed to be stopped for the greater good no matter what she claimed Even more interesting was the presence of what seemed to be the full lineup of potential party members on offer from the original Baldur? s Gate almost all with extensive new voice acting provided by the original actors The handful of new party members fit in so smoothly with the old cast that I couldn? t immediately tell who was new and who was a returning character I particularly liked Corwin the straitlaced archer with the Flaming Fist raising a daughter on her own even if her romance option had her mooning over love right from the moment she joined my party I was soon dragged into the events of the plot and held spellbound for over hours of play Quests were a nearly perfect blend of generic delivery jobs and suitably creepy or epic assignments accompanied by the slow but steady level and loot advancement and the usual range of monsters from aerial servants to evil mages to myconids to zombies Sometimes it was nice to zone out and acquire a bear pelt or collect a few unique items for a reward and easy XP Sometimes it was nice to focus in on the brutal battles that accompany exploring the temple of a traitorous dwarven lich or to take on a group of necromancers creating undead with the possible help of a spectral dragon or to cleanse a druid? s grove of stinky evil Nothing was dragged out too long either Everything that I was tasked to do had a sensible purpose which kept my interest every step of the way Bugs and some lingering annoyances with the interface dogged me every step of the way though While nothing here was a show stopper I experienced a number of hard crashes that dropped me to the desktop and some quirks like respawning enemies quests that weren? t fully resolved in the journal and a bizarre issue with the Bag of Holding that saw items placed there regularly duplicated Endless Arrows of Fire were always welcome but the amount of clutter that accumulated in the bag became pretty irritating after a while The interface remains unnecessarily clumsy when it comes to inventory management I probably spent as much time collecting sorting and selling items as I did battling monsters and exploring sinister crypts Getting killed is still a ridiculous situation It? s simply not acceptable that dead characters drop all their stuff immediately and force you to spread their gear amongst your entire party if you need to trek back to civilization for a Raise Dead spell And even if you have a character in your party with the ability to cast Raise Dead the resurrected character comes back naked so you still have to dress him or her back up again Since the battles here are typically quite challenging on the regular Core difficulty setting expect to re dress your characters dozens of times during the campaign Returning home to Baldur? s Gate makes Siege of Dragonspear one of the most enjoyable RPGs that I have played in a long time both for the nostalgia factor of revisiting an all time favorite and for the impressively designed and involving narrative that captures nearly everything that fans love about traditional D amp D Even though the engine creaks in spots the overall experience is everything that a hardcore D amp D fan could ask for and a superb expansion of one of the most legendary franchises in all of roleplaying game history Ska Studios predominantly hand drawn art in Salt and Sanctuary is deliberately rough around the edges a stylistic carryover from its Dishwasher series It leans on the darkest of earth tones which is fitting for a game this gloomy and unwelcoming You couldn? t fault a Ska fan for mistaking Salt and Sanctuary as a sequel to The Dishwasher at least at first glance beneath the familiar presentation lies a game that s more like Dark Souls than anything else Anyone who has played a Souls game before will immediately recognize how committed Ska was to creating a D version of From Software? s landmark series You see it in the user interface from the grid inventory system to the exhaustive character details that rates stats down to the decimal You feel it when you stop pretending it? s a hack and slash game and embrace defense as much as offense creating a more gratifying tactical experience Salt and Sanctuary successfully mimics Dark Souls punishing yet rewarding style of combat It culminates when you reach the first boss The Sodden Knight He? s an apt introductory boss who trains and humbles you through hardship and death Every boss encounter is a lesson in behavior and attack memorization and it s rewarding when you learn to instinctively predict an incoming combo and come up with the right response in the blink of an eye This form of reciprocity doesn? t always guarantee success There are a few bosses that follow up combos with unexpected single strikes which can throw you off your game if you were eager to pounce and lower your shield While you can argue that it? s a cheap and frustrating boss maneuver it? s thankfully not a common occurrence Many of the tactics required for survival in Dark Souls in particular the roll dodges and liberal use of shields are just as necessary in Salt and Sanctuary Upon a second play through you wonder why you ever struggled with many of these bosses to begin with Salts are this game? s souls You lose them when you die and you have only your next respawn to get them back from the place you perished prior Carrying a lot of salt will present leveling opportunities as well as increased tension in a game where the risk of death is pervasive Salt and Sanctuary also adheres to the classic JRPG resurrection economy where a mystery cleric takes a percentage of your gold after each death Salt and Sanctuary? s world is both heavily gated and backtrack intensive The overall structure is made up of foreboding outdoor areas and labyrinthine interiors It? s its own kind of Metroidvania world where progression involves a mix of straightforward advancement past bosses and the acquisition of new skills There? s gratification in finding shortcuts to areas that were previously separated by hours of playtime The same positive sensation is felt when you learn the ability to walk upside down Numerous areas that were inaccessible are now within your reach and your hardest decision is choosing where to go first It? s a lovely problem to have Salt and Sanctuary? s vague lore from its weapon descriptions to character classes adds a great deal of mystery It? s intriguing to deduce the strengths weaknesses and weapon specialities of each class Like test driving cars spending hours just to find the right one for you feels like time well spent There? s mystique to the names of the bosses like the Untouched Inquisitor and The Third Lamb The process of mentally filling in the gaps with the clues goes hand in hand with the fiction you create for yourself as you pick up the game? s scant nuggets of exposition Even the story itself starts off with an enigmatic tone where the initial premise of rescuing a princess is not as straightforward as it seems Salt and Sanctuary is a wonderful experience despite its grim presentation Where ? Salt? represents the intensity of battle ? Sanctuary? stands for the various safe havens that offer respite These checkpoints primarily serve as hubs for the player to increase levels stock up on items and gear and activate co op Playing with a buddy is notably beneficial during boss fights where one can serve as a decoy while the other friend takes point on offense Each sanctuary is tied to a particular faction referred to as Creeds In keeping with the game? s cryptic designs studying the differences of each Creed is a process but one worth completing You can increase your devotion to a faction by offering the remains of the foes you? ve vanquished Higher devotion results in improved vendor inventory but there s a more important reason to choose your Creed wisely leaving one in favor of another causes the jilted faction to turn hostile I was inclined to keep the peace during my playthrough content with one of the first Creeds I came across whose wares were strong enough to help me complete my mission Salt and Sanctuary is wholly engrossing from every angle from its happy marriage of combat and exploration to its ominously gripping art direction Its world is rich in ambiguity well designed to fill up message boards with discussions on the theoretical histories of its bosses to the origins of the seven Creeds For as much as it unabashedly borrows from Dark Souls it? s an achievement that Ska Studios managed to give its homage an identity of its own that can be appreciated on its own merits Bravely Second End Layer is a sweeping adventure through Celtic myths pirate legends and science fiction fairy tales It s an ambitious amalgam and in other cases might approach overkill But while poor writing and forced plot po As the sequel to s Bravely Default End Layer returns you to Luxendarc a land of arid deserts and snowcapped mountains Throughout your travels you l The story serves mainly as a means to pull you between Luxendarc s locales offering new macguffins on a whim as you navigate class struggles and solve a variety of political disputes along the way At first End Layer s variety is suspect It s hard to tell whether it s a wild western medieval journey or dystopian sci fi drama But after several hours it s clear the game is using the gamut of genres to introduce aesthetics and characters just for spectacle s sake At this point I m content to let it unfold curious as to what I ll see next During one sequence you find a noblewoman starving in a seaside hut make your way through a medieval battlefield and stumble out the other side upon a festival of lights in a warm lamplit city This all happens in under an hour End Layer s characters function mainly to push the plot forward End Layer s characterization and dialogue don t reflect the same ambition though In fact its main character a young cavalier named Yew Geneolgia is cloying from the start His catch phrase Go for the Gravy interrupts emotional silences His reactions to plot twists are rarely believable His optimism and candor remain static throughout never drawing any real meaning from his sense of innocence and naivete Few of End Layer s characters display much dynamism but Yew is the embodiment of the poor writing choices that drag the adventure down The supporting cast doesn t help much either Although they first poke fun at Yew joining you in your disbelief they soon add painful dialogue of their own After a momentous mid game boss fight characters expound on Yew s slogan chanting This is our coup de gravy One NPC obsessed as she is with cats tells the party she found them using the meowformation superhighway End Layer also breaks the fourth wall several times throughout often during pivotal plot moments and it feels forced every time These meta moments which I won t spoil here are interesting concepts on their own but the story doesn t earn them They cheapen what little drama the writing already struggled to impart While End Layer s narrative fails however its combat succeeds The turn based title brings back the Brave and Default system established in its predecessor by defaulting each character enters a defensive stance and saves up brave points which allow them to use multiple actions in one turn Do this without defaulting though and you re useless for the next several turns End Layer benefits from this risk reward system much like Bravely Default did there s an inherent tension when choosing between careful defense and all out aggression The now eponymous Bravely Second ability also reprises its combat role The mechanic allows you to stop time granting one character an extra action during that turn further increasing the possible ability combinations against your enemies It s especially useful against tougher bosses where each turn carries more weight than it might otherwise All of this combat is built on the franchise s recurring Job system Jobs and the array of possibilities surrounding them are Bravely Second s lifeblood As with the game s varied locales its class system borrows from a plethora of genres there s a templar there s an exorcist there s even a cat person There are jobs in total and each character can equip two at a time By joining the passive abilities of one with the active attacks of another you create your own disparate sub classes to further your goals End Layer s class system is as much about experimentation as it is execution Luxendarc s cities display a gorgeous water color style Throughout my journey I defaulted often with my Bishop in order to heal my whole party in one turn Furthermore I used that character s secondary Wizard abilities to spray a healing mist over his allies even without further input they gained health on their own as I focused more on the offensive I buffed the best fighters with my Red Mage Braved four times and used their Ninja Fencer and Swordmaster powers to finish off my enemies And this was only one isolated battle Actually acquiring each of these Jobs however leads to problems in End Layer s structure Although many classes are unlocked through the main storyline some are tied to optional side quests that pit two NPCs against each other By choosing sides in the conflict you opt to fight the opposing character thereby gaining their job for the remainder of the game This is conceptually intriguing But it often creates situations where the job you want is at odds with the character you agree with In this case End Layer s story clashes with its gameplay More than once I sided with the distasteful character despite my best intentions She had the Summoner class I wanted or Her Ninja abilities would compliment my Wizard well These are the things I tell myself Without spoiling too much Bravely Second does allow you to retrace your steps in order to collect every job title in the game s latter half But the dissonance of the earlier side missions halts the momentum of the globetrotting plot On that note the sequel s late game hours are far more enjoyable than those of its predecessor The pacing is constant throughout and you witness different areas from those of the first half it s a far cry from the backtracking and tedium of Default s waning chapters Several minor adjustments also compliment Bravely Second s late game pacing The Consecutive Chance ability lets you continue a fight with another wave of enemies so long as you killed the first in one turn The more waves you chain together the higher your experience multiplier climbs The mechanic seems banal at first but when the grind starts and you re teaching each character a new Job it s a welcome addition that keeps you in the fight and rewards your intelligent combat choices Jobs are the lifeblood of End Layer s combat There s also the option to preset your Job configurations to save your favorite party arrangements Rather than reassigning everyone s abilities before every difficult boss fight or new area you can just select one of the presets to expedite the process It removes the tedium and saves you a handful of hours you might otherwise spend in the menus Despite End Layer s late game improvements and the variety of locales on display here it s worth noting how familiar the sequel can seem as a whole for large chunks of the game you re revisiting the same cities and dungeons as those from Bravely Default And the combat despite its sleek design doesn t make any major improvements on the well established formula These complaints don t affect the game s overall quality but considering the time the first installment took to beat End Layer imparts a sense of deja vu more often than I prefer One could argue it feels more like an exceptional expansion than a true sequel But in the end Bravely Second transcends the limitations that its poor writing and redundant storyline create It s a grand adventure in every sense of the phrase whisking you across exotic environments and satisfying your curiosity every step of the way It has its restraints but as the story closes on the plains of Luxendarc Bravely Second s grasp more than matches its reach One of the most famous quotes in baseball history comes from Wee Willie Keeler When asked about the secret to his success at the plate and what advice he might give others the tiny right fielder replied simply ? I have already written a treatise and it reads like this Keep your eye clear and hit ? em where they ain? t that? s all ? Which brings me to MLB The Show Like Keeler the latest addition to Sony? s long running baseball game franchise is also one of the greatest of all time once again making its spectacularly realistic simulation of the National Pastime seem awfully easy Even though the series has been so good for so long that I? m always tempted to take it for granted every spring I find that the game has been improved just enough over the previous edition that I can? t imagine going back to its predecessor This year is no different While the features list doesn? t contain any showstopping changes the new MLB game has grabbed me yet again First up is the overhauled Road to the Show This combination of franchise play and role playing where you create a teen phenom and guide his progress from the minors to the majors is always where I spend most of my time so I am happy to report that this mode has been substantially improved for Granted the biggest change is the ability to finally play a full series in a row and upgrade skills  grinding it out in high school and college in advance But it? s still a nice added touch that makes the subsequent draft feel like less of a crapshoot The other main area of MLB The Show that has been jazzed up for is Diamond Dynasty It still seems awfully fussy to me more of a store for player cards and attribute boosting gear like special bats gloves and the like than a coherent sidebar to the main Road to the Show franchise and one off match up styles of play There is a lot of content here now like the ability to sign on with one of a handful of MLB star captains like Josh Donaldson for specific goals the chance to fulfill missions and even the option of buying classic stadiums like the Polo Grounds and Shibe Park As in previous entries in the franchise though there is a clear nudge toward micropayments in Diamond Dynasty Many of the items on offer here cost more than you could earn via gameplay unless you quit your job and devoted your life to arcade baseball on a full time basis It? s also annoying that so much is locked out at the start of play Of course you never have to buy anything but the tease is always there wouldn? t it be easy to spend a few bucks in the real world and pick up a power boosting Sam Bat or two Still the addition of two new modes of play in Conquest and Battle Royale did pique my interest Conquest is a fantastic single player idea where you create a team of randomly assigned scrubs and try to take over the U S A plus Toronto which floats off the map above the Great Lakes by conquering territory from neighboring franchises and challenging other teams for some of their fanbase all done via turn based strategizing and three inning games Consider it baseball Risk I can see Conquest becoming an addiction too as I got hooked on a ? one more turn? cycle just playing the game for this review in an attempt to dominate the Midwest Some more tips need to be provided for the various stages of play however as the game dumps you into the deep end at the start with little guidance for how to attack and defend your territories Battle Royale while attractive at first seems like more of a stunt to have any lasting appeal It? s an online tournament that pits drafted teams of players against each other Prizes for multiple wins include packs of player cards and access to the best players in the game including a roster of MLB legends You only get one round free though Subsequent entries into the Battle Royale cost stubs the in game currency which again ties back into the whole storefront angle of Diamond Dynasty that turns me off You can earn stubs pretty readily during play but it? s still a deterrent that rewards those with tons of grinding time and those with a willingness to whip out a credit card More casual players are something of an afterthought here I experienced a bit of lag in each of the Battle Royale games that I played online just enough to occasionally interfere with batting It could be lived with although any hitching in a baseball game can be a killer Slo mo replays turn even routine double play balls into things of beauty The game s presentation has been slightly improved across the board compared to MLB The Show and it generally looks fantastic under the sun or under the lights Player models are the one exception as they still run the range between photo realistic likenesses and creepy caricatures Too many players have dead doll eyes and spotty facial hair especially the randomly created scrubs in the minors that you see during Road to the Show careers MLB The Show improves in many ways it needed to but don t expect it to feel like a totally new game New features like ShowTime and Conquest along with steady if unspectacular improvements to on field action animations and visuals make for subtly better game that fans of the franchise will appreciate Once again Sony makes it look easy by giving us yet another baseball simulation that not only hits ? em where they ain? t it clears the fences completely on a regular basis Enter the Gungeon is a game I should love It? s a dungeon crawling bullet hell roguelike that has a whimsical soundtrack and great visuals But all of this personality and style is undermined by conflicting concepts and Enter the Gungeon s lasting appeal suffers for it Ultimately Enter the Gungeon is spoiled by how it fanatically adheres to the rules of all the genres it blends together It? s a roguelike meaning death in the Gungeon results in a complete loss of progress There? s nothing particularly wrong with this it prides itself on being a bullet hell shooter with steep difficulty spikes but its insistence on stripping away all progress at the start of each run is oil to water when mixed with its focus on collecting zany items and weapons Lookout the past There s a target on your head There are a large number of weapons to discover and use and these range from familiar firearms like shotguns and automatic rifles to more absurd creations like a gun that shoots sharks Likewise there? s a massive number of items to be discovered offering different stat bonuses and perks to be used in varying situations The most powerful and unique weapons come with their own distinct animations and application and figuring out the best way to use them during hectic combat situations is as fun as it is challenging Opening each new chest in the dungeon evokes the same feeling of anticipation as opening a brand new pack of trading cards What will you find Will it be rare and awesome or all too common But there? s a catch here the scales are tipped in favor of the player finding a more mundane or mediocre weapon a large percentage of the time Strange as it is to say there may be too many weapons in here While some feature entertaining and quirky attributes many feel like variations of your starting weapon with barely any major distinctions between them They? ll get the job done but it? s a letdown to discover a wicked laser gun one round and be saddled with a handful of slightly more powerful rifles for the next few A bit of trimming down to make extraordinary weapons a more frequent drop would help to foster the ? one more round? mentality found in great roguelikes You eventually gain the ability to seed each dungeon with items and weapons but you always have to start with the same wimpy load out made up of so so weapons and various character specific items It? s like playing Pokemon but instead of adding new Pokemon to your team and using them at will throughout your journey you? re constantly forced to begin again when you lose any battle with only the Pokedex serving as proof of your discoveries And whenever you have to start over you? re more likely to find a slew of ordinary Rattatas or Zubats while only occasionally encountering something more notable It? s a contentious combination Enter the Gungeon? s fetishization of wacky guns and the meager drip feed exposure a player has to them begins to deliver diminishing returns Having some amount of meaningful progression beyond filling up a log book with found items would help greatly even if it was simply granting the player minor stat boosts or occasional upgrades The Ammonomicon contains small quirky details about every item and weapon in the game This conflict is unfortunate because everything surrounding the core of Enter the Gungeon is great Enemy types are as varied as the items themselves each with their own particular attack patterns that eventually lead to an epic barrage of bullets to be dodged and countered Well balanced and finely tuned control mechanics like a dodge roll with several frames of invincibility or bullet wiping blank rounds arm players with just enough options that they can successfully evade fire while doling out punishment in harrowing encounters and each dungeon level has its own theme to keep the visuals fresh Visually Enter the Gungeon is stunning Care has been placed in the smallest details mixing its retro inspired pixelated artwork with more contemporary styles of visual feedback There? s tremendous impact to each of the on screen actions Books burst into clouds of loose pages when shot or kicked explosions rattle rooms and a generous color palette creates an interesting gothic fantasy cartoon fusion that aligns with the game? s darkly humorous tone When coupled with a pulsing energetic soundtrack Enter the Gungeon is an audiovisual treat Its flaws elsewhere are all the more disappointing So much care is apparent in its construction but in its attempt to merge multiple genres and styles together Enter the Gungeon? s most important elements namely its roguelike flavors and massive offering of distinct weapons don? t gel It? s a game at odds with itself Ratchet amp Clank is proof there? s still a lot of mileage left in the D platformer genre It? s less of a reboot and more of a return to form revitalizing and updating the franchise while simultaneously keeping its use of inventive weapons alien worlds and quirky attitude intact Resurrecting an older franchise can be a gamble but here the payoff is plentiful Ratchet amp Clank is a technically rejuvenated version of the PS classic It returns to the same alien universe taking both Ratchet and his robot friend Clank to multiple planets during their adventure True to the series history there? s a large arsenal of weapons to play with many of which have multiple applications in combat The Pixelizer is a powerful blaster converting enemies into their bit forms causing them to burst into a mess of colored squares when defeated The bomb glove returns as a helpful grenade tossing weapon capable of devastating large groups of enemies The Groovitron kicks out a funky beat and distracts enemies from attacking by launching them into a dance frenzy Each weapon is distinct and all of them have robust upgrade trees to make them all the more effective against the many different enemy types Ratchet prepares for the Galactic Ranger trials There? s a generous offering of gadgets as well including a modification that turns Clank into a jetpack and the Tresspasser device that grants Ratchet access to new areas through a hacking minigame Items are arguably more important than the weapons since a majority of each level is built to utilize different combinations of the items Ratchet has collected In an effort to streamline the process necessary items are automatically equipped to Ratchet via interaction points in each level allowing you to focus on building up your weapon upgrades and tinkering with the guns that best suit your play style As a bonus there are benefits to backtracking to older levels and using newfound items to gain access to previously unavailable areas Although it maintains the same tight and restricted environments of its predecessors there? s a great deal of verticality hidden elements and side objectives in each level to lend players more content to dig through Each environment features beautifully detailed worlds teeming with life A level? s objective flow sticks to its traditional format of visiting planets defeating enemies and moving on to save another planet in peril while continuing the story While the objective rarely changes however the way things are accomplished do One level may be a dogfight in the sky in which Ratchet has to take down enemy warships another may be a smaller more puzzle focused challenge for Clank to resolve They? re not as prevalent as the standard third person shooter platformer levels but they do serve as a nice challenge in between Ratchet amp Clank is delightfully self aware The story begins with an imprisoned Captain Qwark the egomaniac leader of the Galactic Rangers with whom Ratchet has a somewhat colorful history Throughout Qwark narrates the story while telling a fellow inmate about how he first met Ratchet Qwark is endearing for a narcissistic buffoon and his narration is central to Ratchet amp Clank? s charm He? s sometimes unreliable embellishing parts of the story to make it seem more grandiose and heroic Other times he comments on the player? s in game actions with Ratchet making small remarks about Ratchet? s lack of gadgets or movement which is as entertaining as it is helpful He? s not the only standout performer either Virtually every character in the game has a generous amount of quirk poured into their personalities After helping him repair his ship one technician tells Ratchet he? ll see him in the next reboot Another character is an aloof professional athlete with a demeanor not unlike competitors in the early years of the X Games And one of the main villains Chairman Drek is the wonderfully greedy and smarmy uber executive he? s always been Ratchet celebrates accomplishing a lifelong dream The strength of each character is important because the story itself is probably Ratchet amp Clank? s weakest point It? s a basic story about two hapless misfits who set out to achieve a dream and save the galaxy from catastrophe at the hands of greedy and mad antagonists Other than a rushed and awkward ending there? s nothing unforgivable about it It just serves more as a vehicle for the characters who outshine everything else in the narrative Ratchet amp Clank? s finest attribute is its visuals Nearly everything about it is absolutely stunning from the environmental design to the character animations Each planet visited in game looks different from any other with brilliant color and texture popping on the screen Characters? distinct designs are borrowed from aspects of their personalities from the goofy soul patch and sunglasses of Skid McMarx to the sickly pallor of the evil Chairman Drek The animations are beautiful lending characters an elasticity in their movement making them appear both cartoony and fluid This along with detailed particle effects and vibrant environments make the game visually spectacular Ratchet amp Clank is every bit as dynamic and fun as the original It? s endearing and entertaining a veritable power fantasy fueled by rockets and carried by specialty gadgets Re introducing a classic franchise to a new generation is a difficult task indeed but Ratchet amp Clank is a shining example of how it can be done
