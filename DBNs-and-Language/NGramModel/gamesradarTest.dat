It's a narrative that's been done before in games, the "oh, you're actually the real monster all along for playing this terrible video game" trope like Bioshock or Spec Ops: The Line. But Superhot avoids a lot of the pitfalls of this kind of story by walking that edge between dire seriousness and smirking satire. It's a game about video games and our own compulsions to see them through to their conclusions, and it uses these meta storytelling devices - fake operating systems, hidden games within games, IRC chat rooms, and more - to pull you further and further into its web. Superhot wants you to play along with it, and even though it's trying to tell you to stop playing, it never wants to make you feel guilty for taking part in its story, as dark as it may be. It's like an interactive Cronenberg movie, and Superhot just wants to take you along for the twisted, self-referential ride.

The Xbox One version is more or less exactly the same as the PC version, but there are a few things that don't translate well to consoles. You can still record replays thanks to the Xbox One's built-in video recording feature, but as far as I can tell, there's no way to upload those clips to the developer-created 'Killstagram' website like you can on PC. The closed nature of the Xbox One console also causes some of the more impressive fourth wall-breaks of the PC version to ring a little hollow. Gameplay-wise, though, the Xbox One version plays just as smoothly and is otherwise just as fun as it is on PC.
Superhot values planning, anticipating enemy movement, and keeping tabs on every single degree of space around you. Getting a handle on each level is tricky at first, leading to a handful of quick deaths as you learn the enemy patterns and weapon placement. Fortunately, restarting is quick and painless, and levels are generally short enough to make you feel like you've overcome massive odds without being overly frustrated. After you finish each stage, you're treated to a replay of your actions in real-time - several minutes of methodical movement and planning stitched together into one 15-second clip of expertly choreographed violence, all while a deep voice bellows the title refrain over and over again. Super. Hot. Next level. Replay. Super. Hot. Again. It's intoxicating.

There are moments where Hyrule Warriors Legends really gels. Firing up a super move in the middle of an oncoming crowd, triggering a slow-motion effect before sending an entire army tumbling some 30ft backwards looks superb. And the constant affirmation that comes from levelling up messages, mission complete fanfares and last-minute heals does make for an entertaining, pleasant experience. But this kind of game needs to be hyper-slick to stand out, and Hyrule Warriors Legends isn't slick. Passable, certainly, but not the stuff of legend.One of the things that people like to complain about when it comes to the main Pokemon series is that fights feel slow and nothing actually hits your opponent. Pokken Tournament rectifies that by letting trainers ‘synergise’ with their Pokemon, taking on their form to kick the crap out of someone else’s treasured pet in a straight-up fighting game. You can cut a Pikachu to ribbons using Weavile’ claws as your own, or freeze the mighty Garchomp with Suicine’s Ice Beam

As a weekend obsession, Alienation offers plenty of fun and enough depth to keep you firing away till the end of the story. Housemarque grafts a decent looting system onto their usual twin-stick template, and the rush of weapon-hunting with pals is easily worth your time and money. Once you get your bearings with it, you’ll be very happy to find these aliens invading your PS4.


Not that you’ll just be worrying about a couple of aliens, mind. The screen is usually teeming with hundreds of the blighters. Thankfully, the dash and melee combo reliably buys you valuable space, as well as adding a strategic edge to combat. You can dash into groups to knock them down, then mop them up or zing away from them, giving you enough room to keep the bullets flying. The speed and ferocity of how you deal with the otherwordly onslaught is typical of Housemarque. They completely nail the power balance - you’re into a killing machine one moment and alien scraps the next.

The big haul the gang are after this time is the treasure of the Pirate Every, who lived somewhere between 1659 and 1696. There’s some uncertainty there because no one really knows what happens to him, but what is known is that he was one of the most successful pirates the world has ever seen, uniting several other captains into a raiding squad that ultimately netted £52.4 million in today's money. A 1709 pamphlet called ‘The Life and Adventures of Capt. John Avery; the Famous English Pirate’ has him escaping to Madagascar to set up a pirate utopia (and, by the way, while ‘Every is the accepted spelling, both history and the game occasionally throws in the alternate ‘A’ spelling). However, Libertalia, the pirate city named in Uncharted 4, was actually the creation of another book called ‘A General History of the Pyrates',  another popular book at the time but potentially more a work of fiction than factual account.
It can create exhilarating moments: when everything hits its mark the expanded repertoire gives the game a wonderful breadth, providing the player far more agency to engineer their own mini-adventures from encounters - 100% stealthing an area, fudging it with grenades and running, or sliding uncontrollably towards an abyss before leaping into the void with a last minute rope swing largely built on hope. The fantastic looks, improved mechanics and extra freedom make for some really impressive moments.

As for that much vaunted TV show? It’s not awful, but neither is it worth the precedence it takes within Quantum Break’s overall format. Made up of 25-minute, live-action episodes that play out in between the game’s Acts, it tells the story of what the antagonistic Monarch corporation is up to in parallel to the in-game narrative. Fuelled by stock characters you’ve seen countless times in mid-tier TV – oddly good-looking tech nerds who bemoan their supposed social awkwardness with witty verbal flare, the goon with a heart of gold, who we know is good, because look, his wife is pregnant – it actually does a good job of fleshing out Quantum Break’s lore and characterisation, and is key to explaining motivations and twists that would otherwise seem entirely inexplicable.


Dark Souls 3 hasn't so much learned from its predecessors as devoured them, ripping into their narratives and geographies as it searches for a way of standing apart, of starting afresh. Roving the realm of Lothric is like wading through an enormous intestine, swimming with gobbets of the original game's Lordran and Bloodborne's Yharnam - a familiar statue, a ring's item description that hints at a forgotten ancestry, a particular area-of-effect attack that had me shouting in recognition even as it tore my health bar in two.
Dirt Rally is a racing sim that recalls an era long gone, before tutorials and hand holding. It’s curious that Codemasters has decided to attach its latest rally sim to the Dirt brand - a series that, along with its sister franchise GRID, was famed for allowing players to rewind time when they made a mistake, as well as decorating the action with something as close to a storyline as you’re ever likely to get in a racing sim.
So Street Fighter 5 is brilliant with caveats, then. But it is, at its core, still brilliant. Being brutally honest, your mileage with it – during the early phase of its life at least – will vary greatly depending on the availability of fight-ready friends in your immediate vicinity. Its pleasures are great and many, but for all of their eagerness to please, you’ll really need to explore them shoulder-to-shoulder with others. That, of course, is why the heart of any great fighting game truly beats, and Street Fighter 5’s beats as hard and loud as that of any you care to mention. As such, it would be a real shame if the curious new players it has so much to offer were turned off by its limited early content.

And then there’s dem feels. While each level is almost staggeringly pretty, as snow gathers on Yarny’s little woollen legs and the boughs of trees bend gently under your weight, each one has an unshakeably bittersweet edge. The memories you unlock all centre around the rebuilding of the elderly woman’s photo album. It’s here, as you collect a unique knitted heirloom from each level, that Unravel gently begins to gnaw at your heart. As Yarny collects each token and sticks it to the front of the album, a new story is unveiled, introduced by a small paragraph of text.

Combat, meanwhile, is the one of the few areas where the game doesn't represent a stark improvement for the series. As in Chronicles India, remaining especially stealthy during missions will get you a high score in one of three categories (Silencer if you went for knock-outs, Assassin if you preferred kills, and Shadow if no one even knew you were there), which nets you points you'll need to buy important upgrades with, like extra health or a bigger pouch for bullets. Meanwhile, getting into a fight gives you the lowest possible score whether you win or not. Given the high cost of those add-ons and bonuses, being punished for combat in even one section can mean missing out on any boosts you were hoping to get. Russia is thankfully not as difficult to navigate without upgrades as India (you won't run into any puzzles that virtually require you scooped up the previous level's prize), but still, fans who prefer a direct approach won't find a lot to love here.

Everything about Lego Marvel's Avengers feels just a little bit low-rent, a little bit slapdash, a little “A for effort.” It’s a clunky, cludgy mess that hopes you’ll have so much fun watching the Avengers assemble (and disassemble) that you won’t notice how badly it’s been put together. Die-hard Marvel fans (especially of the young variety) will undoubtedly enjoy getting to Hulk Smash no matter what, but everyone else should seek out one of the many truly excellent Lego games to get their own brick-building fix.

Ah, Life is Strange. The hella kool elephant in the room. There was little chance we'd get through this review without bringing up the other character-driven, teen-focused, photo-snapping adventure game. Oxenfree gets a lot right that Life is Strange got wrong (you'd never catch Oxenfree's teens dirtying their mouths with dire-logue like “go fuck your selfie”). Difference is, Dontnod made a game that had a smart gameplay mechanic along with a compelling story. Great characters and an outstanding dialogue system make Oxenfree an easy recommendation for fans of interactive storytelling. It's the lack of challenge and underutilised radio mechanic that make it harder to recommend as an adventure game.

Ultimately a simple platformer with some good ideas and lovely art style, Chronicles India stumbles because its different pieces don't work together cohesively. It's worth a play if you absolutely must partake of every Assassin's Creed game, or if you're a determined stealth aficionado willing to overlook its flaws. Otherwise, just stick to Chronicles China - you'll be happier in the end.

So Street Fighter 5 is brilliant with caveats, then. But it is, at its core, still brilliant. Being brutally honest, your mileage with it – during the early phase of its life at least – will vary greatly depending on the availability of fight-ready friends in your immediate vicinity.

The criticisms sound bad but you'll understand why they don't matter. Firewatch is linear, short, gives the illusion of choice without ever really branching away from the core story and offers little in the way of replayability. But that's absolutely fine. This is the kind of game you simply have to play once. Like Journey. Yep, this is as good as Journey. Rougher, certainly, but just as shining an example of a game that does something different, does it superbly, and stays with you long after it's over. You'll never forget Firewatch.
