You’d struggle to find a more solitary pursuit than rallying. Often with no other cars on the track, taking to the road with the sole goal of posting the fastest time is an unashamedly lonely experience. It’s also one that, from Dirt Rally’s opening menu screens right through to the deep and dirty action itself, Codemasters has looked to replicate in a manner that hasn’t been attempted for a decade or so.

No such measures are taken within Dirt Rally. Within 20 minutes of picking up your first car, you’ll take to the track in the snowy slopes of Switzerland and the plains of Finland. Before long, you’ll be having a splash in the muddy fields of a damp and dreary Wales. DiRT Rally never lets you take a ride on a test track, or flash scores of instructions across the screen. You belt up, listen to your orders from your co-driver and go.

Rather than taking you directly to the game’s showroom to pick up your first car, Dirt Rally trusts you and lets you buy one at your own pace. It’s a small point, but one that sets the tone for everything that follows. On the track, Dirt Rally is a particularly unforgiving beast. Every bump, every puddle, every patch of ice has an impact on your vehicle. That’s especially true during your first championship, when you only have access to a batch of cars from the 1960s - cars which sometimes drive like an old tin bath with four pram wheels stuck to the bottom.



It was when attempting to scale the heights of the Swiss alps in the now 50-year-old Lancia Fulvia, wheezing as it does like a 40-a-day smoker, that Dirt Rally’s true intent became clear to me. This is not an arcade racer, or even a rally sim for the fans of the popular but comparatively simple Colin McRae. Dirt Rally is a genuine, blunt simulation of rallysport. If you think you’re going to get an easy ride in the first contest or two, you’re mistaken. You’ll be lucky to even finish.

Fortunately, however, Dirt Rally gives you plenty of races to recover. Championships, which make up the main thread of play, are broken down into multiple events, which in standard rallies consist of four separate time trials. With no indication as to how you’re doing other than split times comparing you to the race leader, success in Dirt Rally is a case of keeping your car on the straight and narrow, pressing your foot down when you dare and listening to the ceaseless commands from your co-driver. Throughout play, he is your one consistent aid, although listening to his calls - which rarely leave room for breath - feels like cracking a code Alan Turing would be proud of. There’s no “easy left” or “hard right” here. Every bend is graded from one to six, with 90 degree turns or hairpins highlighted with particular caution. Crests, bumps, and hazards all tumble from your co-driver’s mouth like a foreign language. Visual aids stream across the screen at the same time, in an attempt to keep you up to speed.



At first, attempting to follow commands in any meaningful fashion seems like an impossible task, but it soon starts to feed into your subconscious. Focusing on the vanishing point and delicately snaking your way through its stages starts to become second nature. The variety of these stages is arguably Dirt Rally’s greatest strength. Speeding through the forests of Finland is a distinctly different thing to successfully scaling the icy heights of one of the game’s many mountain passes. Jumping from one event to the next constantly keeps you on your toes. With its narrow, perilous tracks, Dirt Rally never allows you to feel comfortable.

Crashing into a stray tree or clipping a stone wall not only slows you down, but also has an impact on your car. Tires burst, radiators overheat, and you can frequently find yourself hobbling over the finish line with a slack time simply because you’ve lost control of your car once in an otherwise clean and competitive race. Veering off track or recovering your car after flipping it will trigger a time penalty. A bigger concern is the ease with which you can write your car off altogether. Repairs can be carried out in between races, but major incidents in the middle of a challenge can be fatal, with restarts chipping away at the credit you pick up for completing an event. It's perfectly fair, but devilishly unforgiving.



As an aside to the standard rallies, Codemasters has also spiced up play with hill climbs and official FIA World Rallycross Championship challenges - the latter enabling you to race other cars directly on the track. These rallycross events are split into qualifying heats, semi finals and a final encounter, with a 'Joker lap’ - a trickier, longer stretch of track you have to deviate down at least once in a race - adding a smart tactical element to proceedings. The better you perform in these rallycross encounters, the more credit you pick up at the end.

It’s this credit that enables your progress. Success in Dirt Rally’s championship lets you to purchase new cars in additional classes (15 classes available in all, with 46 cars on offer in total) and upgrade your existing vehicles. Switching off all driving aids rewards you with additional credit at the end of each event, and you can also alter the sensitivity of your drive to suit your tastes, softening the suspension or switching the brake bias to fit your driving style. For dedicated players, fiddling with these settings is a time consuming but rewarding sideline which, once mastered, can shave vital seconds off your best time.

Dirt Rally seems designed to ensure that you get the most out of the cars you already own before taking the step up to more powerful beasts. As your ability increases, your engineers become better equipped to deal with each car the longer you drive it. In a game where success intentionally feels like a hard earned treat, the knowledge that sticking by the four wheels you own - rather than racing ahead to something more lethal - is a comforting one.



There are opportunities to drive Dirt Rally’s more advanced cars sooner rather than later, however. Online daily challenges enable you to race cars already in your collection, or those still locked away in the main game. They also contribute credit to the main pool, enabling you to keep progressing through championship after championship while breaking play up with a fresh challenge at the same time. It’s a balance that enables Dirt Rally to stay varied without diluting it with any short-term arcade thrills.

More than anything, it’s Codemasters’ decision to chase realism that will both entice and repel players. This is the rally sim that Richard Burns fans have been waiting the last ten years for, but Dirt Rally’s remorseless tracks, designed to punish the faintest of mistakes, will mean many quit before they’ve truly started. It’s hard to imagine Dirt Rally scaling the top of the charts for too long, if at all, but for dedicated rally fans this is as true an incarnation of the sport as you’re likely to encounter

At times this is a purebred Dark Souls sequel, a labyrinth of faded masonry populated with suspicious-looking gargoyles, where you'll wage ferocious yet dignified jousts against knights equipped with swords and spears. But then the skin splits and it's a Bloodborne sequel in all but name, offering up pyres of burning corpses and wiry, crimson-eyed abominations who'll knock you off-balance with raking combos or slide around your defences, reaching for your jugular. Sometimes you feel like a survivor, inching through deceptively beautiful chambers with shield held out like a letter of apology. And sometimes, you feel like a tiny but terrible predator, diving through the swipes of giants and dragons to strike at ankle and underbelly.


The two styles are expertly blended over the course of a majestic 60-70 hour adventure, and you can, of course, shift the emphasis by tweaking your character's stats appropriately. But one significant drawback is that Dark Souls 3 lacks a voice of its own. In broad terms it's a rewrite of the original: the player is once again a cursed undead, resurrected to seek redemption by slaughtering corrupted beings and exchanging their souls for level-ups and gear. Your quarry this time are four wayward Lords of Cinder, whose embers must be restored to their thrones in Lothric's version of Lordran's Firelink Shrine. As with Majula in Dark Souls 2, the latter now serves as a distinct customisation hub, accessible via teleportation from bonfire checkpoints out in the world, where you'll encounter merchants, a mournful Firekeeper who handles character levelling and Andre, the original game's grandfatherly blacksmith.

Talk of Dark Souls 2 may give seasoned Souls cartographers the shakes, but fear not. Dark Souls 3's geography isn't nearly as disconnected, though it can't rival the exquisitely meshed, wraparound terrain of the original. The game takes place in the grounds of a gigantic castle, spilling down from airy battlements to a village, forests, a cathedral, a diseased swamp and skeleton-ridden catacombs that take you beyond the curtain wall to a frostbitten citadel. Many of the key locations are visible from a distance, and, as with Lordran, contemplating an area you've just overcome from a precipice satisfies in a way no item reward ever could. All that toil and terror, all those agonising scraps with the dregs of series creator Hidetaki Miyazaki's subconscious, reduced to a huddle of turrets on the horizon.



MAGE WARS

One area of Dark Souls 3 that could do with patching, the performance issues aside, is magic. At the time of writing, characters who rely on sorcery and miracles seem weak next to melee characters. Pyromancy specialists have a better time of things, because the pyromancy flame at least doesn't weigh you down like a wizard's staff or a priest's charm, allowing you to wield it comfortably alongside a hefty greataxe. Bosses also skew towards speed and aggression in this game, so hanging back to throw spells is less of an option.
Certain sections are quite linear, but even the most claustrophobic is packed with secrets and shortcuts – an item dangling from a window you can't reach from inside a building, or elevators that save you the trouble of tussling with minions en-route to a boss. You can also trigger key encounters in different orders given a bit of calculation, perhaps unlocking alternative endings in the process, and there are entire regions, together with important NPC sidestories, that you'll miss if you fail to heed the clues squirrelled away in the dialogue and lore.

Lothric's splendour is, alas, hampered by a few too many callbacks to locations from previous games, though the idea is often as much to desecrate as celebrate. More problematically, the game's single act narrative arc robs the world of thematic weight. There isn't that renewed sense of purpose you may have felt on obtaining the Lordvessel in Dark Souls 1, or downing Rom in Bloodborne. Bosses, meanwhile, run the gamut from the surgical through the grandiose to the slightly gimmicky. There are entities you'll best by dint of meticulous pattern-reading and a sixth sense for the difference between a combo finisher and a linking attack – gruelling encounters that represent videogame combat at its most sophisticated. But there are also big bads that are more about spectacle, where victory is a question of poking a vulnerable bit till it pops, or exploiting something in the environment, though it may repay you to fight without resorting to such measures.



It's a tremendous rogue's gallery for the most part, with each enemy a grotesque expression of some cosmic failing or tragedy, but I'm not sure there's a star - veterans hoping for a clash as smart and punishing as Ornstein and Smough may leave disappointed. My standouts include the Dancer of the Boreal Valley, a crooked yet balletic titan whose fluid animations are difficult to time, and Aldrich, Saint of the Deep, a grisly sorcerer with a very, shall we say, close relationship to Lords of yore.

The combat system itself remains substantial and punchy, despite a frame rate that sinks well below 30 during more SFX-heavy battles. It's built once again around blocking, rolling, backstabs, parrying and two-handing weapons for extra damage, but there are now Weapon skills – florid category-specific specials such as charging spear strikes and guard-breaking uppercuts that devastate when they connect, but generally leave you wide open when they don't. These draw on a new Focus Point gauge that's also drained by magic (spells no longer have a set number of uses), and is refilled by drinking new “Ash” Estus flasks that share inventory space with the basic health-replenishing variety. Naturally, tethering magic and weapon arts to the same resource pool obliges you to be clear about which style you favour. Are you the kind to lob lightning bolts and poison clouds, or would you rather raise the might of your axe-swing care of the War Cry skill?

The skills system seems more skin-graft than sea-change, in hindsight – I polished off most AI opponents using the older tactic of riling them from afar with fireballs, then somersaulting in and out of swiping range. But the true test of its worth will be how it holds up in PvP over the months to come. As in previous games, forging “covenants” with certain elusive NPCs opens the way to particular flavours of multiplayer. Disciples of the sunlight covenant are pillars of the community, placing their summon sigils to aid those struggling with bosses or nefarious red phantoms. The latter, meanwhile, are Lothric's highwaymen, invading worlds to murder their hosts.



In place of the original multiplayer Humanity system, Dark Souls 3 gives you Embers that can be crushed in return for a health bar extension and the ability to summon co-op partners, at the price of opening the door to a possible invasion. It's a simplification that may annoy returning players, but it does make crossing the barrier between solo and fully online play much more tempting, which should result in a livelier PvP community. From has also streamlined equipment upgrades - you can no longer reinforce armour and clothing, which scales up with your character's level. There are still plenty of armour sets to collect and play around with, however - some built to last, others for agility - and the overhauled weapon customisation is robust enough to pick up the slack. In addition to raising the base strength using titanite, you'll discover gems that apply status effects or scale a weapon's power based on individual stats.

It's a persuasive reshuffle of the feature set, on the whole, reinforcing the original's machinery while throwing in a few new wrinkles for veterans. But it's expressive of a game that's more about putting a capstone on a formula than raising the roof. Dark Souls 3 is a vigorous tale of sacrifice and cunning. It is oblique, punishing and gratifying in a way mainstream console blockbusters seldom dare to be. But the fires are definitely dying. There's been some uncertainty over whether this is the final Dark Souls title – Miyazaki has suggested as much, but the endings contain dutiful hints about future sequels. As much as I love Dark Souls, and as much as I've enjoyed this one, I think it's time to say goodbye.

You probably know the story of Icarus. That Greek guy who made a set of wings, stuck them together with wax, but then flew too close to the sun, melted said wax, and plummeted to his doom. He’s long been the go-to analogy for over-ambitious projects that fail due to unchecked determination. But what if, instead of flying too high and getting royally messed up by the day-star, Icarus had drawn up a great design for his wings, and then decided – possibly under the advice of committee – to add an armchair, a foot-rest, a sandwich toaster and a small patio? Imagine if, with all of these undoubtedly fantastic, high-end features attached, he leapt off the cliff expecting the most comfortable and well-equipped flight in the history of flight, and instead tumbled immediately into the sea under the unnecessary weight of his unwieldy additions.

Yeah, Quantum Break is a bit like that.


Announced as the figurehead for Microsoft’s original Xbox One strategy of blending games and TV together into a delicious, frothy, media milkshake – until MS realised no-one liked how that tasted and cancelled the whole plan – Quantum Break is one-part kinetic, shooting spectacle, one-part static viewing experience, and one part wondering why no-one saw that things weren’t hanging together properly. It’s not that any given element is bad – the TV show segments aren’t great, but you’ve probably seen worse – more that each of Quantum Break’s various constituent parts fail to convincingly connect with the others, leading to a piecemeal, Frankenstein experience unable to use any of its promising but discordant assets to their full potential.

ADVERTISING

Starting with the game’s main positive, the core shooting experience is certainly capable of delivering a great time. Combining satisfyingly tactile gunplay with an array of quick and immediate time-bending powers – most of which, pleasingly, are furnished early on, expanded only by incremental upgrades across the course of the campaign – at its best, Quantum Break’s combat is a fast, rangey, excitingly free-form experience.



JUNCTION WARS

Before each episode of the TV show, you'll play a quick 'Junction' section. These non-violent, dialogue-driven sequences cast you as chief bad guy Paul Serene, and allow you to make decisions that tweak the way the story will play out. You'll influence things like which employees he trusts, and whether he uses PR or oppression to clean up a corporate mess. Though don't expect any Walking Dead-style agonising. Paul's clairvoyant time powers let him see exactly how things will play out before choosing, making it all a bit of a non-event.
Over the course of any fight (except in odd spots where certain powers are disabled) you’ll likely find yourself using every trick at your disposal. You’ll teleport in and out of cover, and warp-sprint between hails of gunfire to deliver knock-out melee blows. You’ll control space by trapping enemies in pockets of stasis and loading them up with frozen bullets, your salvo ready to hit simultaneously once it regains its momentum. As you dash about the place, you’ll even create impromptu safe-zones on the fly, by deploying bubble-shields of slowed time in which to regenerate health, relatively safe from incoming fire. When in full flow, it’s a lightning-quick, improvisational carnival of unfolding options and self-made advantages, allowing you to mould and reshape the flow and pace of battle on a whim. It’s exhilarating, and very, very empowering, indeed.

But that, actually, is a bit of a problem. If anything, it’s too empowering. Quantum Break quickly makes you such a gleeful master of your surroundings that, even when facing off against enemies with watered-down variants of your abilities, you’ll rarely feel challenged. Taking apart each battlefield is always fun, but with enemy AI hardly oppressive and the game’s more interesting heavy units rationed off for far too long (they rarely integrate into larger fights, usually appearing as imposing but easily dealt-with gimmicks) you’ll all too frequently sprint across the line between ‘powerful’ and ‘godlike’. Spam out the time powers freely enough, and genuine challenge becomes a rarity, for all of the frenetic pace and visual sparkle at play. What should be a meaty and engaging combat model often ends up feeling a little lightweight.

It’s ironic, given that the game’s story focuses on the breakdown of the flow of time, that pacing and escalation are the biggest victims of Quantum Break’s disjointed structure. Through the campaign, it’s impossible to shake the feeling that the combat would have the time to evolve into something truly gratifying if there was just more of it. Unfortunately, it’s built into a jarringly stop-start structure in which lengthy periods of awkwardly stiff narrative-dump take precedence over the game’s star attraction.



The story itself has a lot of potential. A layered, rather personal tale of two life-long friends - and one brother - locked in an ideological clash over how to deal with a temporal apocalypse brought about by research all three are involved with, it aspires to deal with issues of changing relationships, people growing apart, and objective realism versus optimistic heroism. When a time-travel experiment goes wrong, Jack and Paul take very different paths in trying to tackle the incoming End of Time, in a story that takes in a scope much greater than the day or so it technically plays out across. Because, of course, time travel. The problem comes with the way the story is told.

Perhaps it’s the symptom of a desire to not overload the player with cutscenes, knowing that there’s a full-blown TV show to watch as well, but the majority of the story’s richer lore is delivered via a seemingly endless supply of emails and diary extracts littered about the game world. These are often well-written – though largely missing Remedy’s typically knowing, genre-savvy wit – but the bulk of game time their discovery and perusal demands makes for a rather unbalanced mix. When the peak of your pivotal third act pauses for a 15-minute trawl through the computers of an empty office space, something has definitely gone wrong with your story’s delivery.

And it’s not even like you can afford to skip too many of them. While a lot simply go over old ground, or flesh out concepts you’re already familiar with, there’s some fundamentally important story material hidden among the reading. Indeed, one or two major twists and revelations are delivered only in easy-to-miss notes and diary pages, and the story would be a great deal weaker without them.



There’s a lot of genuinely enriching, supplementary material in Quantum Break’s story, but protagonist Jack’s experience of it skirts largely along on the surface unless you’re willing to break up the brief bursts of giddy combat with long periods of environmental investigation. If you don’t put in the time, the narrative only really hits ‘Holy shit’ levels of intrigue around the end of Act Four (of Five), which - much like the combat’s escalation - comes just too late. There are some nice, if light and very occasional, puzzles dotted about the place during some of this downtime, largely built around the idea of rewinding the individual timelines of objects in order to change the environment. But again, their infrequency stalls them from really growing into something significantly enjoyable.


Rarely though, is it truly impressive, hampered by a lack of vitality and some awful special effects that emphasise that what works for video game visuals does not necessarily translate to live footage. An interesting diversion, but one that ultimately raises the question of what the game could have achieved if the show’s running time had been freed up to further explore the interactive experience.



Certainly it might have tuned up some of the undesirable kinks. While Quantum Break largely looks gorgeous – its clean, glossy design and refracted time-effects make for an effervescent visual ride – it does stumble. I discovered one particularly unpleasant lighting bug along the way that delivered a long-term, full-screen strobe effect that rendered chunks of Act 3 rather taxing – and unsettling – to play until it went away. On the more physical side of things, Jack’s environmental navigation can frustrate as well, his ability to determine climbable surfaces inconsistent enough to force multiple failed attempts at exploration before he deigns that, yes, you were going the right way all along.

Of course, all of these things can be improved with patches – alongside the TV show’s catastrophic streaming problems pre-release; I’d strongly recommend you download the episodes from the Store before you start – but alas they won’t fix the things that hold Quantum Break back in the realm of ‘fun’ when it should have been great. It’s a frustrating situation. The elements of a fantastic and creative action game are all present and correct, and at times Quantum Break is indeed both of those things. But unfortunately its various disparate parts tend to get in each other’s way, leading to a needlessly complicated presentation that inhibits anything from shining as brightly as it should.

What we have here is the all-time greatest game based on a movie based on a game. Granted, the only competition is the abysmal Street Fighter: The Movie, but still - Ratchet & Clank is a thoroughly enjoyable reboot for the widely adored duo, improving on the PS2 original in every way while staying totally accessible for newcomers. Even if the story suffers from its attempts to tie in with the upcoming movie of the same name, Ratchet & Clank is a strong PS4 debut for the series that recaptures the pure, plain ol' fun of the best 2000s-era platforming. And one thing's for sure: the loveable Lombax and his trusty robot pal have never looked better.

In case you've never played a R&C game before and/or haven't seen any of the recent film trailers, this is a loose retelling of how Ratchet and Clank met and saved the galaxy (for the first time of many). For those who've played the original, the return of certain planets, side characters, and level layouts will tap into your fond memories, while the reworked aiming and strafing controls will make you forget all about the comparatively awkward setup from the first game. The redone, buttery-smooth controls are crucial, because as you probably know, half the fun of R&C games is derived from blasting enemies to bits with destructive (and hilariously inventive) weaponry.


Ratchet's selection of Gadgetron-manufactured firepower is a pleasant mix of old and new; each weapon serves a unique purpose, and can be leveled up and upgraded at your leisure for a satisfying power curve over the course of the game. They also lend themselves nicely to some particularly devastating combos, like creating a small army of deadly droids with a Mr. Zurkon plus a Glove of Doom, or pairing up the weaponized Groovitron disco ball with the area-of-effect energy bursts of the new Proton Drum, creating the world's most chaotic dance party as enemies are repeatedly zapped with pink shockwaves. And you really need to see the Pixelizer in action, simply for this fresh weapon's glorious graphical effects: anyone hit by its shotgun-style blast will suddenly morph from three dimensions into 2D pixel art. Use it for a killing blow, and you can even smash up the chunky voxels that make up their retro-looking remains.



COLLECT 'EM ALL

On top of all the collectibles in Ratchet & Clank, like the well-hidden Gold Bolts or some precious Raritanium used to upgrade your weapons, the reboot offers an ingenious collectible: cards bearing the likenesses of iconic R&C characters from throughout the franchise. You can find packs of these cards stashed in out-of-the-way areas on each planet, or score individual picks just by killing enemies - and there's a gameplay purpose to expanding your collection. Manage to find the three cards in an individual set (or trade in duplicates for the ones you need), and you'll activate permanent buffs, like doubled Omniwrench damage or additional bolts per drop. It's a relatively minor yet magnificent addition to the game, especially for completionists... and if you want the best weapon in the game, get ready to go on the hunt for some particularly rare cards.
On top of the Pixelizer, Ratchet & Clank is a graphical marvel throughout, where the in-game visuals could be mistaken for the slick CG of the animated film. Richly detailed backdrops bursting with color, adorably expressive animations, the impressive fireworks during combat, even the texture of Ratchet's fur - it all looks phenomenal, and marks a milestone for 3D platformers being just as pretty as Pixar films. While it's a shame that the PS4 debut doesn't strive for 60fps, the framerate stays constant even in the most visually intensive, particle-effect-filled battles, and the sight of bolts (classic R&C currency) floating towards you by the hundreds without a hint of slowdown is simply magical. Each planet has a distinct look and feel, from the metropolis on Novalis to the tropics of Pokitaru, and new levels (like a valley of volcanoes you explore via jetpack) show off some seriously impressive draw distances and environmental flourishes. Their layouts make for first-rate platforming, with multiple objectives, clear indications of where to go, a healthy amount of challenge, and plenty of intriguing 'I'll be sure to come back for that' moments when you spot a secret area but don't yet have the right gadget to access it. Clank also stars in some new puzzles, with short, satisfying solutions that offer a pleasant change of pace from Ratchet's running and gunning.



While the visuals achieve graphical parity with the film, the story struggles to find the right balance between adhering to the events of the first game and the scenes from the movie, creating a mild but unfortunate lose-lose situation. If you've seen the film, you might be thrown off by events that don't make sense to the movie's timeline, or be irked by how often it incorporates abridged clips from key scenes. Those who haven't yet seen it (which applies to almost everyone at launch, as the film won't be in theaters until the end of April) will have a hard time following some of the plot threads, which force certain characters from the film into the spotlight even if their personality or motivations were never properly established. But it's hard to get too upset over the story inconsistencies when the writing is so humorously self-aware and thoroughly charming. It's especially nice to hear Ratchet's rightful voice actor James Arnold Taylor doing his take on the character's origins, and the new script excises all of the unneeded smarm that plagued Ratchet's personality in the original PS2 game. There's also a delightful new framing device: Captain Qwark's eventual betrayal is given away right from the start, as he narrates the entire game while telling his side of the story from the confines of space prison.

All told, the budget $40 / £28 price tag on Ratchet & Clank feels just right. It took me just over 8 hours to finish the main story, and I look forward to more hours spent chasing down weapon upgrades, collectible cards, and cheat-code-enabling Gold Bolts (with even more mileage awaiting those brave enough for the amped-up difficulty of the post-credits Challenge Mode). There are some minor things to gripe about: the last fifth of the game feels a little padded out, you're only afforded one save file, and the final boss is predictably frustrating (I imagine he'll give younger players fits). But the good far outweighs the bad, and after some experimental entries on the PS3, Ratchet & Clank is a entertaining return to form for the series. This is a reboot done right, recapturing everything that made the original great and making substantial improvements for a new generation.

It’s a good end to Nathan Drake’s adventuring life, if not a great one, as Uncharted 4 brings the series to a close. Mechanically it’s the most confident Uncharted yet, with fantastic rope swinging traversals and satisfying fights, but there’s also clutter. Levels that would only improve the flow with their removal and an occasional overuse of interactions that only really get in the way

The revitalised gameplay is largely excellent. Where before the game was a linear theme park ride, there are now hub-like areas that are open to player exploration and interpretation. There’s more freedom as a result mixing in tightly scripted action with the chance to just sort of take it all in. Which is a plus as it’s also spectacularly pretty - jaw-droppingly so - from vistas and locations, to character animations where the slightest facial tic or muscle shifting under the skin brings Nate and company to life in an alarmingly eerie way.

ADVERTISING


Drake’s obsession this time is the treasure of a mysterious 17th century pirate said to have escaped with over £50 million in today's money and disappeared somewhere around Madagascar. Cue travel, exploration and punching masked men from behind walls.  We’ll start there because the combat gets the most love in among the overhauled mechanics, replacing linear shoot outs with more open areas you’re free to approach in different ways.

To help manage these larger hubs you can now tag enemies, making pure stealth one of the most satisfying ways to deal with bad guys as you dash between patches of tall grass and prowl for necks to snap. That’s just my preference though. There’s still plenty of exploding barrels, high ground and other choices, making the experience far more interpretive. Levels are far less set in stone, and how they play out is shaped more by preference and luck than a fixed design.

Exploration is similarly enhanced thanks to these larger spaces. There are slopes to slide down, a rope you can use to swing across expanses, a piton that must be forcably smacked into surfaces to gain purchase and occasional access to a jeep in bigger areas. All of which combine to create a feeling of actual exploration with multiple routes and paths.



A PIRATE’S LIFE


Which brings me onto that earlier mention of clutter. And Sam - Nathan's newly discovered and never before mentioned brother. His forceful retconning means the game has to tell two stories - Nathan’s search for the Pirate Every’s treasure and the brother’s previously unmentioned existence. All the flashback/backstory levels and anything relating to Sam, including Sam himself, could simply be cut to create a shorter, better game - just Nate and Sully hunting for treasure. That’s where the game really starts and it’s about five hours in, except Sam replaces Sully most of the time.

The Sam-related levels aren’t bad, they just get in the way. The game has to work so hard to establish this interloper that much of the opening is ‘Expositional Climbing: The Game’. (A few later levels could also easily disappear without harm.) My playthrough lasted about 16 hours - cut the preamble and Sam-building and you’d get a 10 hour game that started with treasure hunting adventure from the off. The indulgence on Sam would be easier to forgive if he was likable, but he’s not. He’s consistently shifty and untrustworthy - an unusual misfire for Naughty Dog which has such a good track record for great characters, and even the unnaturally charismatic actor Troy Baker can’t make him likable.

The rest of the clutter comes from a mild overabundance of little moments and extras. Naughty Dog has previously talked about how fans liked little interactions like patting a yak in Uncharted 2, or trying on masks in The Last of Us’ Left Behind DLC, and the studio seems to have taken that to heart because it’s everywhere. There’s an entire level in Nathan’s house, and one where all you do is pick things up in exchange for dialogue. NPCs also occasionally stop talking now unless you prod the conversation back to life via a prompt floating over their heads.

All nice ideas, but overused here, missing the point of what made them special before. Previously they were sparse, optional little moments that changed pace and added a lovely depth to the world if you found them. In 4 it’s all just a little overcooked. Like no one knew where to stop.


However, the opening gets a pass to some extent because it’s all new to start with and you don’t know quite where things are going. And, fortunately, just about the time all the jumping about passes from novelty to fatigue, the game begins in earnest. I’m keeping this all spoiler free so I won’t say where, but at a certain point you reach a location and Uncharted 4 starts. From then on in it’s adventure and puzzles and shooting, and it’s great.

Once things kick off properly it’s the treasure hunting adventure you know and love. It’s beautiful and vast, with astonishing locations and things to see. Unfettered from the need to flesh out characters and the past, the game finds a consistent momentum. Our heroes clash repeatedly and more frequently with the bad guys as they get closer to where X marks the spot and, generally, the last half of the game is the romp you’ve been hoping for.

The multiplayer also benefits from the new mechanics, creating a hugely mobile online fight as you swing and climb to get the upper hand on opponents. It also adds in new supernatural elements culled from previous games. Things like El Dorado, a huge gold statue that can be summoned to spit out lethal homing spirits. Or the power of the Djinn, a teleporting speed and melee boosting power up. Then there are the friendly combat NPCs like snipers and medics that can fight alongside you. All of which can be bought, using in-game cash earned as you play and adding a tactical edge as you save/spend your gains. It’s fast and chaotic fun, adding welcome extra life the package (but let’s be honest, who buys Uncharted for the multiplayer?).

And that’s as much as I’ll say because I can’t address the actual ending in any way without spoiling it or flavouring expectations. As a game, though, it’s a good conclusion for the series overall. Sure, it’s a little loose at the start, and tonally it tries hard to be so serious and grown up, but once it gets all that out of its system the Uncharted-ness comes through and we get to take Nate for one last spin, ‘Oh Craps’ and all. Housemarque’s efforts to keep the twin-stick shooter alive and spin-firing in the 21st century provide some of the best arcade thrills on PSN. Super Stardust HD chews up time like a starving rottweiler and Dead Nation makes slaughtering zombies feel fresh (well, fresher than the corpses you’re retiring, at least). Alienation may share similarities with previous games, but their latest offering channels XCOM and Destiny, adding levelling and looting with mostly positive results.

It takes place on an Earth colonized by Roswell’s most infamous inhabitants, placing you in the metallic boots of one of three super soldiers ready to rid the world of Xeno scoundrels. There’s the medic-in-all-but-name Bio-Specialist, the semi-stealthy Saboteur and the pie-and-mash Tank, who, as the name implies, is the slow but solid class. They’re diverse enough to really pick a favourite and stick with them - for me, you can’t beat the Saboteur’s combo of temporary invisibility and laser guided missle strikes.



You’ll want to get them onto the killing fields as soon as possible to see how tangible the world is. It looks stunning for a top-down shooter. In Alaska, snow flakes constantly drift across the screen and your tiny hero leaves footprints where he runs. These engrossing details are expertly combined with great particle effects - explosions that spread across the screen, and sparks which dance away from bullet impacts. The level of graphical fidelity makes up for the uninspiring art style. It’s a standard hodge-podge of XCOM extraterrestrial types (oh look, scuttling bug creatures!) and apocalypse tropes. You’ll still coo when you watch an alien bodies flying towards the screen, though.

Before each mission, the game dispenses some painfully corny exposition and dialogue (hats off to voice actor who managed to squeak out the Ed Wood-esque clanger “If you want to save your chromosomes, I suggest you get out of there”) before dropping you into a massive map. The simple quests are an excuse to start hurling aliens at you. It’s similar to spiritual predecessor Dead Nation, but much faster. Aiming is a breeze thanks to a blue laser which constantly shows which direction you’ll fire, and there’s a nice snap to pulling the trigger and watching E.T.’s angry cousins fall at your feet.



INVASIVE TREATMENT

There’s an intriguing PvP mode called Invasion, where you can jump into the game with random players and rain misery on their alien-thwarting attempts by blasting them to plasma pieces. There’s a reason I call it intriguing though - it’s another victim of the game not explaining its concepts well, as it’s unclear exactly how to invade other games. My team did get invaded once throughout our playthrough - we gave them a close encounter of the dead kind, but it was hardly memorable. If the PvP malarky isn’t for you, you can always disable it in the start menu.

Add a few mates and the action becomes wonderfully chaotic - the screen resembles a Jackson Pollock original when your squad are bulldozing through alien hordes. Setting up games is tremendously easy, and online players can randomly drop into your games. On one occasion, I was one alien claw away from death, only to have a stranger join and scythe his way through the monsters attacking me. It’s a head-scratching decision why this is online-only, however, as it would be tense, pad-crushing, couch co-op gold.



What really keeps you barrelling through the missions is the promise of better weaponry. The grind for XP allows you to upgrade your active and passive abilities, as well as being the game’s main source of bragging rights at the end of a level. Looting is a huge addition, with various guns and grenades split across five categories, ranging from stock shooters to legendary weapons that can only be recovered from the battleground. The fun doesn’t stop there, though. Upgradable cores add extra damage or improved fire rates, with a spreadsheet’s worth of numbers explaining how efficient your new toy is. Chopping, changing and testing weapons is just as exciting as the initial buzz of finding them.

The problem is that the game never satisfyingly explains these systems. The first few hours involve tentatively fiddling in weapon menus, probing away to see how it all works. There are tips you can cycle through on the loading screen, but it’s not enough to explain the concept of your special attacks, let alone the concept of rerolling - the weapon stat system that involves you collecting and salvaging resources to randomly add effects to your gun. I was halfway through the story before I discovered on a loading screen that blowing up respawn beacons improves the loot you get at the end of missions - not great for a game that revolves around finding the best weapons possible.

That’s assuming you manage to drag yourself to the end of missions. Alienation is clearly designed to be enjoyed with online company, so gunning solo often results in death. The revive function is a multiplayer-only feature, and the level of experimentation that comes with combining different class abilities is the primary pleasure of the game. Housemarque is clearly steering players towards multiplayer - it’s just a shame that single players pay for that with an experience that feels less balanced.



Reaching the end is merely the beginning though, as your first run-through is essentially an extended tutorial. You come out of the finale only to be told to do it all again, against harder enemies. This unlocks UFO keys for loot runs, and Ark keys for more PvP fights - both things which get very little explanation. It’s churlish to complain about having too much to do, but the lack of personality compared to the likes of Destiny or The Division means once the loot loses its appeal, there’s little to keep you grinding away through the same areas again and again.


Unbelievable. How else could I sum up my disappointment in the supposed grand return of a franchise that hasn't seen a decent entry in nearly twenty years and explain how it's a perfect representation of the Wii U's core failing as a console? Every fear that the Wii U's Gamepad is a gimmicky albatross around Nintendo's neck comes to fruition here, as Star Fox Zero's attempts at legitimizing that idiosyncratic bit of tech become its undoing.

The most exasperating part is that, on paper, Star Fox Zero should at least be a pretty decent time while it lasts. Developed in conjunction with Platinum Games (the team behind the spectacular Bayonetta 2), Star Fox Zero occupies a strange place in series canon. It's neither prequel nor sequel, but rather a reinterpretation of the events of Star Fox 64 (which itself was a reboot of the original Star Fox on SNES). As Fox McCloud, the head of do-gooder mercenary group Star Fox, you'll move from planet to planet, defending the galaxy's citizens from Andross and his evil armada. This usually involves piloting one of several different vehicles depending on the situation, spending time in a series of on-rails sequences (which funnel you forward to a destination), or in larger, open combat arenas. It's your job to fly or drive around and shoot down everything in sight.


In Star Fox Zero, you do that by physically moving the Gamepad around to aim your Arwing's reticle, while using the analog stick to move your craft. It's as awkward and ungainly as it sounds, like rubbing your stomach while patting your head - only you have to simultaneously avoid incoming laser fire. Many of Zero's stages (its larger, screen-filling bosses in particular) require that you shift your focus back and forth between Gamepad and TV screen while you're thrusting your Gamepad around to aim your shots. Maneuvering land vehicles in particular feels like unbridled chaotic flailing (and not in a good way), and for a series that typically values precision under fire, this is a problem. To top it off, you'll find yourself mashing the Y button to recalibrate your aim every few seconds.  After a few hours of play, I felt like I was finally getting the hang of things, but there was never a moment where I felt like Star Fox was better served because of these controls.

This is a damn shame, because when it works, Zero can feel as thrilling as the best moments from Star Fox 64. Part of this is, admittedly, because Zero copies many of the same story beats and action sequences of its predecessors. If you've played any of the original games, you'll probably recognize a lot, like the opening assault on Corneria, your scuffles with rival mercenary group Star Wolf, or the fact that Falco continues to be a giant tool. It can seem like a rehash at times, but the way Zero pulls in elements from different parts of the series makes it feel like a greatest hits compilation, even bringing in deep cuts like the chicken-like Walker originally intended for the cancelled Star Fox 2. Platinum's own penchant for big explosions and theatrical set-pieces elevates these new approaches to old levels more often than not, where a dogfight quickly morphs into an assault on a galactic cruiser, causing you to fly through a gap in its shield, transform into your walker, take it down from the inside, then zip away before it blows up.

TOWER DEFENSE

The retail edition of Star Fox Zero includes a copy of Star Fox Guard (also sold separately on the Nintendo eShop), a tower defense game that teams up Slippy Toad with his uncle Grippy as they protect their power core from endless waves of evil robots. It's… actually pretty fun! The TV screen is filled with a dozen cameras, and you use the Gamepad to switch between them so you can gun the robots down before you get overwhelmed. It's not terribly deep, but considering you don't have to move the Gamepad around to aim, you'll probably have a better time with it.
The wholly original creations within Star Fox Zero don't fare so well, though, and piloting the brand-new Gryowing in particular is a plodding chore. It slowly hovers from point to point, its blasters are piddly peashooters so you're better off avoiding combat altogether, and you use it to open locked passageways by hacking computers with an attached robot. The constant start and stop required to solve these inconsequential puzzles turn a potential palate cleanser into a pacing killer, especially when compared to the other, far more exciting vehicles you have at your disposal. Luckily, you only fly the Gyrowing in a couple of levels, and most of the time Zero knows to focus on what it does best: moving fast and blowing stuff up.

Another thing Zero copies from prior Star Fox games: you can finish it in about two or three hours. Like its predecessors, the replayability here comes from exploring levels you've beaten already, looking to increase your high score while searching for secret medals and hidden paths. It's also pretty light on additional modes. Other than the campaign, there are handful of training missions and an additional mode to unlock. Without a proper competitive multiplayer mode to fall back on - there's local co-op, but it's just the same campaign levels with one player flying the ship and the other aims and shoots - the whole package feels very slight.



But slight is fine if it's at least fun to play, and even a perfectly designed campaign packed to the rafters with content couldn't cover up the awkwardness of Star Fox Zero's controls. That's what's so disappointing - there are moments of greatness in here, little sparks that, despite other flaws, remind me why I loved Star Fox 64 in the first place. Unfortunately, all of it is constantly undermined by a slavish devotion to wrapping the core design around every feature of the Wii U's Gamepad, regardless of whether it makes sense or feels good to play. 19 years is a long time to wait for a game to live up to the legacy of Star Fox 64, but we're going to have to keep waiting. This game isn't it.

Shoving the Zelda universe into Dynasty Warriors' mass-brawling action template was a polarising love/hate affair on Wii U. But whichever camp you find yourself in, on 3DS, you're essentially getting the exact same game (plus some minor additions), only not as good. It's no disaster, by any means, but if you have the choice and want to play it, do so on Wii U. Now that's out of the way, let's take a closer look.

You play as Hero of Time, Link, to begin with, followed by an increasingly diverse range of familiar Hyrulian characters, as you fight swathes of enemies across open battlegrounds. Besides the slaughter, you'll be defending and winning keeps, completing objectives (defend this/kill that), finding special items and then returning to the core element: mashing the two main attack buttons a lot. Yes, yes, there are plenty of unique, useful moves hidden away in command strings, but pressing buttons kills lots of things in a very old-school kind of way.

ADVERTISING



And 'lots' of things is an understatement. You'll probably kill a couple of thousand enemies within an hour's play, and since each battle lasts in the region of half an hour apiece, that means an awful lot of the game relies on the act of cutting a swathe through dense crowds of cookie-cutter foes. Demolishing a big group is always satisfying, but when there's a big group pretty much everywhere you go, things do start to feel one-note very quickly.

However, there is enough variety in the combat to hold your interest. The game quickly reveals its depths as you unlock new combo attacks, specials, weapons and characters. If you want to spend time combining weapons, levelling your characters and maxing out their skill trees with badges, there's plenty here to enjoy.



And once you do start injecting magic bar usage, special attacks, potions and other items into the action, the variety improves and the feeling of being able to dominate the battlefield makes you feel like Hyrule's true hero. You're simultaneously a master of combat and tactical genius, spinning several figurative plates at once. Even moreso in this 3DS version, in fact, as you can now switch between playable characters in an instant via the touch-screen, or order them where to go next and what to battle, remotely.

Some of the characters are new for 3DS, and can then be transferred into the Wii U version once unlocked. Tetra and the King of Hyrule are both in, but the headline newcomer is Linkle – the 'female Link' - playable for the first time. She's likeable in a headstrong, totally oblivious-to-the-danger kind of way, and her attack style is flowing and fun thanks to twin crossbows and some surprisingly airborne combo moves, allowing you to rain down death from above.

I'm not going to argue that Hyrule Warriors' gameplay is for everyone. And if the constant combat puts you off, you definitely won't be won over by the quality of the conversion. While the game manages to fill the screen with 3D enemies and cel-shaded elements (which is impressive, even for New 3DS), it looks noticeably rough compared to not just the Wii U version, but other 3DS games in general.



Indeed, switch on the 3D and not only does the frame-rate plummet, the game actually starts moving more slowly. It takes more time to run across the field because the processor is groaning under the weight of having to draw all this stuff twice. It's a proper mess, even on New 3DS, and the 2D mode is the best way to play, by far.

The rest of the conversion feels lazy. The cut-scenes haven't been re-rendered in proper 3D – instead they've had basic 3D relief added to parts of them. Basically, it's a fudge, and little halos of incorrect depth around key items in each scene make it look very strange. So combined with the frame-rate issues in-game, I wouldn't recommend switching on the 3D at any point.



The rather scrappy visuals are offset by a simply superb score, which has made the transition beautifully, belting out hit after Zelda hit, with distorted electric guitars rocking up the already grandiose orchestral arrangements. Sadly, it's over-used during gameplay, the BGM repeating over and over until you turn the sound down, finish a level, or lose your grip on sanity. But returning to haunting melodies on the menu screens will make you pause to listen, especially when using headphones. If only the audio were a bit more dynamic in battle instead of ALWAYS ON AURAL CAPS LOCK, this could have been one of the best-sounding games on the system.


Fights switch back and forth between two phases; Field Mode, which allows you to run around the full arena as a 3D space; and Dual Phase, which sees you square up against your opponent in a side-on, 2.5D view like Street Fighter 5. The shift between the two styles makes for tense fights as it constantly keeps you on your toes, but it’s also overly complicated. Not only is it a change in perspective, but you’ll also need to adjust the way you play. A button combo in one phase will do something different in the other, and certain moves only work in certain phases. It’s incredibly annoying when the arena changes just before you start an attack, and it makes for very messy fighting. Any expertise you may have in other fighting games won’t help you here - you’ll be just as lost as the newcomers.



There’s also a rock/paper/scissors element at play. Grabs break through blocks, blocks cancel normal attacks, and normals override grabs. You also need to consider support Pokemon types, powerful Burst Attacks and between-round cheering (your advisor can give you a boost between rounds by filling your synergy gauge or getting a partner Pokemon ready). Each component is meant to inspire complex tactical thinking, but in practice it feels fiddly. It’s trying to do too many things at once. I felt like I was winning fights through lucky guesses and button bashing rather than skill at reading opposing Pokemon’s moves.

But despite all that, it’s still exciting to be able to actually directly battle Pokemon. Pikachu zips across the field to unleash powerful electric tackles, and Charizard’s flamethrower feels great when it connects. While I’d like to play as even more Pokemon, each one feels unique and has strengths to suit your preferred playstyle. Even the bizarre, light-fixture-ghost-thing Chandelure feels at home in an arena, capable of keeping even the best trainers at bay by throwing various long-ranged orbs, having a low profile, and being a total bastard to fight against.



AMIIBO FUNCTIONS

Pokken Tournament is compatible with every single Amiibo product. Yep, //all of them//. Even the Animal Crossing Amiibo cards. You can tap any collection of Amiibo up to five times a day to unlock a random customisation option such as a new scarf or title. You can also unlock funds for your wallet, but those can only be spent on outfits and hair dyes for your trainer. It’s a great way to reward you for using them that never breaks the balance of the game.
Despite all being various sizes and shapes, they’re all well balanced. Pokken makes things fair by ignoring type advantages from the Pokemon RPGs (water beats fire, etc). It makes a lot of sense, because otherwise normal punches and kicks would pass straight through ghost type Gengar, and where’s the fun in that? Despite the weight difference small Pokemon like Pikachu Libre can still pick up and throw the giant Machamp or Garchomp by using electricity as an extension of itself (or, in the case of Gardevoir, psychic energy). No matter the typing or ability of the ‘mon you’re facing, it never feels like you’re at a disadvantage.

There’s also a strong single-player campaign that puts Street Fighter 5’s non-existent offline game to shame. It sees you work your way up through several leagues and tournaments to uncover the secret behind Shadow Mewtwo. Although weirdly for a fighting game, you’ll also level up your chosen partner by putting points into stats such as strength and defence. While working through the stages and unlocking loads of customisation gear for my trainer is great fun, the levelling system doesn’t need to be there - it doesn’t add anything and it limits you to using one Pokemon to reach the top. You can switch your partner, but you’ll need to level them up to fight in the tougher leagues, so you’ll have to put lots of hours in to make sure your ‘mon stay competitive.



Multiplayer is where you start to notice just how complicated fights can get. The AI in single-player is easy to rally against and overcome, but fights can feel fruitless and disappointing against a real person, especially when it’s difficult to get a read on them. Local multiplayer also has one huge, experience-ruining flaw in that one of you has to play on the cumbersome GamePad with the small and inferior screen as your guide, while the other can use a pad and the TV. It’s a massive oversight, as every match is inherently unfair to whoever is stuck with the GamePad. It’s the gravest of sins for a technical fighting game. It’s been done that way because you can’t follow both players individually in the 3D field phase, but I can’t help but feel that Pokken would be a far better game if it did away with the arena part and just focused on the 2D dueling. You can hook up two Wii Us via LAN to get around it, but it’s unrealistic to expect people to be able to play that way.

Thankfully that’s not an issue when fighting others online as you can use whichever pad you like best. You can choose between ranked and friendly matches with friends or strangers, and you can fight against the CPU while you wait for a match. It’s your standard online fair, but is currently doing one step better than Street Fighter 5 as you’ll actually get punished if you rage quit a match. Not that you'd ever do that. You're better than that.



There are a few other irritants - environments look like layered cardboard cutouts, and you’re guided through the entire game by your coach Nia whose voice acting is so boring even a Pachirisu on X Speed would struggle to stay awake. It’s hard to get excited for a match or feel threatened by a dark force when your advisor is slowly suffocating you with the flatness of her delivery. Mercifully you can turn off her ‘advice’ during a match, which I implore you to do for the sake of your own sanity - it’s a much better game without her input.

If you’re looking for a fun, solo, Pokemon-shaped distraction for 8-10 hours, then Pokken will happily scratch that itch. If you want more of a challenge against your fellow trainers then you’ll be left wanting. The complicated mechanics and mixed controller matchups make fights unfair, which is a shame given how much work has gone into making the Pokemon feel just right. It’s a valiant effort, but it’s not the competitive battler fans were hoping for.

Blood on a pink suit. You play hours of Far Cry 4, inventing increasingly ingenious ways to rid the Himalayas of despotic goons, but that’s what you remember. Blood on a pink suit. Since it settled down into a mechanical holding pattern in its third iteration, Far Cry’s ace in the hole has been its presentation of villainy. The series’ looming Big Bads are part-narrator, part-finishing line and totally, seductively unpleasant. The only reason you remember the definition of insanity is because the guy telling it to you was so damn interesting.

Far Cry’s best trick is never more obvious than when it fails to pull it off. Primal - a new spin-off set in Central Europe, circa 10,000 BCE - attempts to include two villains, totally failing to make either feel threatening or engaging. Suddenly, it all becomes clear - in an open world, where you can go anywhere, being fed choices almost constantly, that evilly grinning focal point is there to keep you on an even keel, keep you working to set things right. And when it’s not there? Well…


Primal’s problem is one of focus. It’s almost mechanically identical to the previous two main games - an enormous open world crossed in first-person, peppered with quests, creatures, crafting and opportunities for psychotropic drug trippery - and as such carries the same simple pleasures. There’s a huge amount to kill, build, upgrade and discover, to the point that you end up essentially tripping over new things to do - but without the nagging sense that there’s something truly bad out there to stop, it quickly becomes a parade of busywork, with very little reward.

You play as Takkar, a man on a journey to the land of Oros, who reunites with the fragments of his lost tribe, the Wenja. The Wenja suck. Oros is also home to Neanderthalic cannibals, the Udam and technologically savvy farmers/firebombers, the Izila. The Udam are stronger, the Izila smarter - by Darwinian terms, the Wenja deserve to be extinct, and if the game is suggesting that we’re descended from them, humanity got a bum deal. It’s Takkar’s job to tip the balance. His course through the game leads him to collect together the scattered remnants of the tribe, forming a strong leadership, and building a functioning village in the bucolic valley he calls home. He does so by murdering almost everything he sees.



HURKAMANIA

Hurk is an unusual tradition. The bearded, yelping Southern man pops up in both of the last two Far Cry games. In Primal we meet Urki, his prehistoric forebear, an aspiring inventor and the game’s comic relief. His best joke? He speaks the same made-up caveman language as everyone else, but in a thick Texan accent. Never gets old.
Primal’s somewhat old-school setting leads to perhaps the game’s greatest change - its approach to weaponry. Rather than the arsenal of ordnance available to contemporary protagonists, Takkar’s got a club, a bow, and a spear, plus a prehistoric toolkit of traps and primitive bombs. This limited selection turns Primal into a far more aggressive game than its predecessors, forcing you out of stealth and into melee combat almost constantly. Come the endgame, this can be spectacular, as you smash enemies out of the way like straw dolls. Unfortunately, its approach to melee is incredibly basic - you can’t even block, never mind vary attacks - meaning you’ll likely have gotten inured to it all long before.

That’s supplemented somewhat by Takkar’s quasi-supernatural ability to tame the game’s menagerie of animals. Collecting the game’s carnivores, bringing them to your side by feeding them bait and shushing their growls/roars/squeaks, became its greatest pleasure for me. Pets act as a tactical advantage, occupying threats while you choose someone else to brain. Again, it’s a shallow mechanic - your control amounts to just pointing your chosen animal where you want to go - but gaining the ability to ride a rare breed of Sabertooth Tiger into an enemy camp and watching lesser enemies flee is a new kind of thrill.



But it’s not enough. Oros is a spectacular place - alternating from thick, light-dappled forests through wind-spiked mountains to fire-ravaged wasteland - but it feels terribly empty for a map covered in Ubisoft’s increasingly traditional quest marker pebbledash. The Udam and Izila questlines make up such a short part of the game’s runtime, and end in such rote boss battles, that they feel sidelined. The majority of your time is spent running fetch quests for members of your village - always violent, but never important. Worst of all, the game’s ‘drug trip’ sequences are consistently more interesting than the main game. One is so ludicrously spectacular that it begs the question - why isn’t this spin-off taking its cues from the similarly surreal Far Cry: Blood Dragon?

Ubisoft Montreal might counter that Primal is more about wearing the skin of a man who wears skins, and there are hints of that in the game’s more survival-based ideas (degrading weapons mean you need to keep a constant stock of crafting materials, and snowy regions introduce a cold gauge that needs to be topped up by resting at campfires) - but it’s a half-baked attempt at introducing caveman role-play when you can also control an owl that drops bombs full of bees, because magic.



The result is a game that feels lacking in most respects. It lacks a clear villain, it lacks a deep enough armory, it lacks direction. Far Cry’s set-up is such that you’ll always be able to make your own fun - and, in the moment, it can be a beautiful, violent thing - but for a game in which characters talk constantly about being remembered by history, it’s a sad irony that - unlike their series forebears - they most probably won’t be.

This game was reviewed on PS4.

Superhot appears almost too simple at first glance. Every one of its white, texture-less stages give off a feeling of clinical, cold sterility; each of the red, faceless crystal 'guys' you gun down shatters into a thousand unfeeling pieces. Even its gameplay is stripped down to minimalist essentials, giving you only a couple of weapons and a handful of possible buttons to press. But inside this restrained simplicity hides an incredibly strategic, elegant shooter with a sinister edge; a puzzle game where the pieces are bullets, and your solutions are largely improvised.

Superhot's tagline is also the best descriptor of its biggest hook: 'Time moves only when you move'. It's not entirely accurate - even when you're standing completely still, the world is still in motion around you, albeit very, very slowly. But when you start moving around or taking actions (like firing a gun or picking one up, for example), everything in the world begins to move in real time.

ADVERTISING


It's a seemingly minor twist to the conventional first-person shooter formula, but it's one that turns a typically high-octane genre into a slow, contemplative burn. You're able to survey your surroundings mostly at your own leisure, and once you figure out your next move, you need to act on it while avoiding enemy gunfire. The simplistic visuals do a lot to aid you here, as you know exactly what your goal is (kill all the red guys), how to do it, and how not to die (thanks to the red bullet trails that bleed out of every projectile).

By changing the pacing, Superhot then becomes The Matrix game we've always wanted but never quite got before, putting you in situations that would otherwise be much too difficult or intense and letting you wreak all kinds of havoc. You'll dance through each of its 26 stages, weaving through bullets, throwing ashtrays and wine bottles at enemies, grabbing their gun out of mid-air, and using their weapons against them as you zip behind cover like the world's greatest action hero. Superhot evokes the best moments from a variety of films (many of its levels are even framed around iconic action flick moments, like Oldboy's corridor brawl, or Die Hard With a Vengeance's close-quarters elevator gunfight), and that feeling of control you have over your surroundings is incredibly empowering, even when Superhot starts throwing seemingly endless waves of enemies at you.

MIND IS (XBOX) SOFTWARE


But it's supposed to be, as all of these levels are couched in a haunting, deeply subversive narrative that repeatedly breaks the fourth wall to immerse you in its story. Superhot isn't just the name of the game you bought on your Xbox - it's also the name of the game within the game. One of your online buddies has hooked you up with an illegal, 'cracked' version of Superhot, the latest craze sweeping the shadier corners of the internet, and as you play, additional levels are unlocked as the internet figures out ways to hack into them. But the more you play, the more you realize something important: maybe Superhot isn't just an innocent game after all. Maybe you should stop playing. Turn off your Xbox. Go read a book.




But just when things start to get really interesting, it's all over. Superhot's story is incredibly short - your first time through will maybe take two or three hours max, depending on how quickly you wrap your head around its gameplay. It's probably better that Superhot gets in and out without overstaying its welcome, but you'll likely walk away with more questions than you had when you started.



That's not to say that the game is over when you finish the story, though. A plethora of endless and challenge modes unlock once you finish the campaign, bending Superhot's mechanics in a variety of interesting ways. You can try to fend off as many red mooks as you can in a variety of different stages, or tackle story missions with just a Katana, or try to finish them as quickly as possible. I hate to say that "the real Superhot starts here", but these modes are where you'll be able to do the most experimentation and wring every last drop out of the experience. You won't get much more story here, but these modes are plentiful, and do a lot to extend the life on an otherwise short game.

So this is the part of the review where I embrace the meta-layer of Superhot's story, and proclaim it to be "The most innovative shooter I've played in years." While I wouldn't go that far, Superhot is most certainly one of the more interesting takes on a proven formula in a while; a more cerebral, minimalistic, and far more twisted spin on the genre, and it's absolutely brilliant while it lasts. Most shooters are considered 'mindless'; Superhot wants you to lose your mind to it. It's a fair trade. Super. Hot. Super. Hot.
Street Fighter 5 wants you to have fun. It is fully aware of just how much giddy, gratifying, intelligent, enriching enjoyment it contains, and its primary instinct is to deliver that to you, as quickly and directly as possible, at whatever level you want to play.

Whichever end of the fighting game skill spectrum you currently stand on, do not take that to mean that Street Fighter 5 has been dumbed down. Hardcore, high-level players will find a vast amount of depth, nuance, and long-term malleability in its bold, immediate systems. And the less expert have a very long and exhilarating road of growth, improvement, learning and discovery ahead of them. The difference this time is that the clarity of Street Fighter 5’s systems and presentation has been tuned to near perfection.


Before a single punch has even been thrown, Street Fighter 5’s disdain for overly complex barriers is obvious. Gone is Street Fighter 4’s Focus Attack system, most crucially. The mechanic was intended as a get-out-of-jail free card in hairy situations, allowing hits to be safely absorbed and counter-attacked, but its secondary use as the primary means of setting up SF4’s most powerful, showboating combos ultimately gated away the fun of the higher-end game from all but the most dedicated and dexterous. In its place – literally, activated by the same, simple two-button press – is the V-Skill. Or rather, the many V-Skills. Because instead of bottlenecking creative play via a very specific route, a la its predecessor, the V system initiates the open, utterly freeform, ‘anything can happen’ play that Street Fighter 5 revels in.

Tap both medium attack buttons together, and your character will instantly perform a special move or attack unique to them. No stick or pad waggling required. And I do mean unique. These things are simple, but immensely powerful game-changers. Zangief, for example, can absorb damage in a similar fashion to the old Focus, but he can also do so while advancing, radically reversing the glacial grappler’s old problem with getting into attack range. Chun-Li will launch into the air at odd angles, throwing off opponents used to her normal trajectories. M. Bison can grab fireballs out of the air and hurl them straight back. Ryu gains the ability to safely parry (and retaliate against) as many incoming hits as you can nail the timing for.

Holding out for Super Hyper Ultra Street Fighter 5: Turbo Wonder Edition? Don't. There will be no traditional expansions this time. Instead, Street Fighter 5's additional characters will be drip-fed into the roster as incremental updates. And in theory, you won't have to pay for any of them. In-game currency - known as Fight Money - will cover the cost, if you've earned enough. But of course, real cash will also suffice if you don't want to wait.
If you need an example of how fundamental an addition the V-Skills are, it’s all there in that last one, which rips out one of Street Fighter 3’s core systems wholesale, and hands it to just one character on the roster. Asymmetry is Street Fighter 5’s thing, you see. Asymmetry, and unpredictability, and dynamism, and creativity. The basics of attack, evasion, controlling space and stringing together combos come packing enough flexibility to keep you going and growing for months – and probably years - but when you want to crank up both the flashiness and the fun, the tools to do so are a simple button tap away.

The same goes the second part of the V system: the V-Trigger. Here, you simply need to hit the two strong attack buttons at the same time, and your character will enter a special, time-limited, powered up state which changes their fighting properties – furnishing, say, multi-hitting attacks, or greater speed or defense - or even gives them new special moves. Karin’s suite of charging-punches, block-breaking overhead hits, and defensive back-dashes is a particularly potent example. Yet more power, yet more options, yet still a minimum of challenge in execution. The various building blocks of Street Fighter 5’s strategic game are simple to grasp and simple to use, but they click together to build systems of immense power and versatility. It all creates the feel of a game that doesn’t want to present any hurdles to your progress, but which rather wants to give you all of its tools up front, and let you get on with building your own fun straight away.



And whatever level you start playing at, you will achieve that. Because all of these systems come alongside a core fighting set-up with clarity at its absolute centre. Control is immediate and flowing, with special move inputs noticeably stripped back for simplicity, quarter-circles very much ruling the roost these days. With combo timings more forgiving than ever, and a fantastic clarity of visual feedback running through every hit, block, and counter, it’s as easy to grasp the logic and strategy of Street Fighter 5 as it is to start having fun straight out of the gate.

The perfect fighting game then? Unfortunately no. Because there’s a rather frustrating irony in Street Fighter 5’s launch day set-up. You see, while the core game is a wonderful, player-minded blend of immediate enjoyment and friendly, long-term lessons, the current content array does not get that across terribly well. Not for the solitary player, anyway. While couch-based vs. play against another human will always be the best way to enjoy a fighter, in these post-Mortal Kombat X days, a strong, inventive suite of solo options is a must-have in terms of easing a player in. And Street Fighter 5, currently at least, does not have one.



Get past the baffling lack of a traditional arcade mode, and you’ll find only Story and Survival set-ups, alongside an unguided training mode featuring customisable AI. Story initially seems promising, but ultimately feels like a half-baked afterthought, delivering only two to four, challenge-free, single-round fights per character, strung together with rather cheap-looking and uneventful motion comics. A proper, cutscene-driven narrative campaign is coming as a free update, and will hopefully rival the later MK games’ fun and engaging equivalents – Street Fighter certainly has the personality to make the idea sing – but it’s only landing in June, which may be too late for players without an immediate crew of fight buddies.

Also coming later – March, this time – is Challenge mode, which should provide a decent training facility alongside the (seemingly now requisite) daily tasks, but being unavailable in the review build, it’s currently impossible to quantify either way. Its arrival isn’t too far off, but again, a very important part of the single-player offering is missing at launch.



This inevitably brings us to the realm of online play, in which findings have been decidedly mixed. When it works, it works very well, fights playing out as well as in a local bout. But in pre-release play, those kinds of results have only appeared about half of the time, the remainder taking in the full gamut of online performance from ‘slightly gluey’ to ‘full-blown slide-show’. Hopefully netcode will be improved over time, but once again we have an area of SF5 where underperformance pushes local vs. play as the only real, consistently viable option.

I hate the word 'cutesy'. It’s something that’s undoubtedly already been used to describe Unravel and yet is somehow completely at odds with the game itself. While you’ve probably already seen plenty of the charm on offer, this beautiful side-scroller deserves your attention far more than its handcrafted sensibilities might suggest.

Erase the inevitable comparisons to Stephen Fry’s brand of sackcloth twee in LittleBigPlanet and instead combine a hand-sewn Portal, a knitted Limbo, and then add the soaring thoughtful joy of Journey. And then, just to slosh in some tears, add the poignancy of the saddest children’s tales you can think of and blend them with Pixar’s Up. Yep, I’m definitely still reviewing a game about a knitted red character jumping through platforming puzzles. Unravel might just prove you’ve got a heart somewhere in that black hole of emotion you call a chest. I know. It broke mine.


On the surface, Unravel looks much like flyaway fluff from little Yarny’s woollen tail. And from what you’ve seen of the game before now, this is likely what you’ll expect. Trotting through sunny days, this red bundle of string leaps from sunflower to sunflower, gets distracted by butterflies, and flies through treetops on a kite. To add to the sweetness, static ‘memories’ appear in the world as you journey through the life of an elderly woman via her collection of photographs. Yarny grabs a bright light from the air as each moment is captured, the delightful string (of course) soundtrack chirpily keeping the world feeling joyous and fresh.

But then there are the levels you haven’t seen. Yarny being crushed by heavy machinery. And eaten by cockroaches. And running along electrical wires only to be fried alive, or perhaps hurtling along the surface of a recently ploughed field, desperately trying to avoid the birds who want nothing more than to have a Yarny as a snack. Mmm, string cheese. The memories that appear change too. Where a snow sequence has children riding sledges, a dimly lit garage sees a man working on past his retirement age. And is that an ambulance arriving...? Unravel isn’t all sweetness and light.



PUT A STRING ON IT

Unravel creator Martin Sahlin actually crafted Yarny when he was on a camping trip in the Swedish countryside with his family. In a tale so indie it hurts, he built the character from wool and wire. “I wanted to share a piece of home I guess,” he said when I spoke to him at Gamescom last year. “I think there’s nothing wrong with video games being sort of fantastical but every game doesn’t have to be like that. I wanted to make something that was just about basically appreciating the beauty that’s here outside your door. You don’t have to go to space, you don’t have to go to a fairytale land because all you need to do is go into the woods and look at stuff.”
Like Limbo before it - but without the the same number of hair-tearing puzzles - Unravel wants to push you to die before you can learn to survive. And there’s no fighting back here, only the avoidance of eager and ever-present death. Crabs viciously snip at Yarny in a sea level as waves crash into the screen. A furious vole attacks when you venture into its hidey hole amidst the phosphorescent glow of underground mushrooms.

Puzzle-wise, you trail a constant thread from your wool-bound body, creating a useful way to retrace your steps. That is until you reach a point where poor Yarny simply runs out of fuel; straining on the knotted leash like a puppy who just can’t reach a particularly deliciously scented patch of grass. Balls of yarn look just out of reach but there’s always a way to get to them.

Jump down into an area and can’t get back up? Hold your left trigger and you’ll climb up your own rope, regathering yarn as you go. When it comes to the other, err, strings to your bow, a knitted lasso lives on the right trigger and lets you swing like a tiny handmade Spider-Man. Yarny can tie wool between anchor points too. Fasten two together and you’ll build a gently sparkling trampoline for bouncing to distant areas, or using as a bridge to drag items across.



While there are a number of puzzles that’ll leave you scratching your head - including a particularly nasty one involving floating on a log across a well - the majority of levels retread a theme of string trampolines, swinging and making the most of the environment. Refreshingly, anchor points are the only highlighted puzzle elements, which means finding your own ways to reach areas. ‘Oh, so these apples aren’t just set decoration’.

Every so often a more complex teaser crops up that forces you to work out the physics of the job at hand. More of these would have been welcome, but each level is so different in theme from the last that the existing puzzles on offer never overstay their welcome. Plus, if you’re really a glutton for punishment, 5 secret extra button collectibles hide in each level and require some serious string management to reach.



While it would be easy to cynically dismiss, these gently remind you of the fleeting nature of life’s little moments and the fact that the photographs you’re collecting are all that’s left of these memories. Flicking through the emotion-skewering real life images, you’ll find pieces of the level you just encountered. A plastic bag Yarny used as a parachute through the countryside is on the foot of man whose boot must be leaking. A bridge that you crossed is the site where a love padlock was snapped closed. Yes. Ow.



The joy - and sadness - of all this is the instant memories it drags up for you personally. Childhood trips, walks in the woods, the choices we make as we grow older, the realisation that life isn’t as long as you want it to be. These aren’t just emotions tied with string to a creature made of yarn. They belong to all of us and almost effortlessly, with some help from a heart-wrenching soundtrack, Unravel manages to elicit far more emotion than I was ever expecting.

There’s a bittersweet edge from the get go but Yarny’s adventure continues, Journey-like in a way that’ll gnaw away at the soul you’ve hidden carefully away. Compared to the cold sterility of a puzzler like The Witness, Unravel is where all the heart lives, and there’s nothing our futile cynicism can do about it. Ironically, this is also a game that - with its beautiful recreation of the natural world - might just drive you to pop down the controller once it’s over and go outside and make some of those moments for yourself.

In Soviet Russia, the game plays you! Or that what I was expecting out of Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia. The third title in the Chronicles mini-series and a slow, bloody sneak into early 20th century, pre-Revolution Russia, it represents the final chapter in an occasionally fun but largely middling set of 2D platforming adventures. Yet, this installment turns out to be a happy surprise: while obvious faults keep it from being great, a decent story, diverse combat, and stealth that offers a satisfying challenge (without dipping too often into hair-tearing territory) all make Chronicles Russia the series' clear high note.

You slide into the valenki boots of Nikolai Orelov, a disillusioned Assassin who plans to abandon his Order after one last mission and leave his homeland of Russia - rife with violence and civil unrest - behind forever. His main means of accomplishing that goal is 2.5D platforming, leaping over rooftops and through more than a few living rooms in a linear approximation of Assassin's Creed trademark parkouring style. Unfortunately for him, like all one last missions, his is extremely tricky: he must steal an item of immense value from the Russian imperial family, who are currently in hiding from proletariat mobs calling for their heads.


This chapter follows through with easily the best story in the mini-series. Nikolai's determination to escape the Order creates a unique perspective, and a surprising twist in the game's opening chapters makes the whole story worth seeing through. That isn't to say Chronicles Russia is channeling Shakespeare - its story is still typically goofy in many ways - but regardless, it's suited to the game in which it lives, giving it a worthwhile narrative center that the previous two games distinctly lacked.

While a decent sense of drama is certainly a plus, the game's biggest strength is easily its stealth, and the way it builds its many lovely environments to accommodate thoughtful sleuthing. Unlike previous entries in the series which really only give you the option to hide in closets or behind a pillars for the majority of their eight-hour runs, Russia offers up a wider variety of stealth-based tools, turning every room into a fascinating, well-paced puzzle of which each of your movements is a piece.



KILLER STYLE

Though it may look a little monochrome at first glance, Chronicles Russia's version of the mini-series' watercolor art style fits gorgeously with the setting it's trying to create. Giving the entire world a stark, dreary look with vibrant splashes of red for drama (and built-in path guidance), Chronicles Russia fashions itself an aesthetic that fits its time period and subject matter perfectly, and looks good while doing it.
Using a telephone in one room can distract a guard in another. Shooting out breaker boxes shortens (but doesn't eliminate) enemies' field of vision. An extensive series of vents in just about every building is bound to save your skin when you mistime a sentinel’s movements and have to dive out of sight. All of this is infinitely more satisfying than hanging out in a bush until the guards' animations cycle and you can tiptoe to the next one.

A much wider swath of environments (from nondescript buildings to blood-strewn laboratories and actual moving train cars) makes the adventure even more involved, giving you the opportunity to really use your ever-changing surroundings to your advantage - for instance, pulling someone out of the window of a moving train pretty much ensures you won't have to worry about the body. An improved control system - which has a few hiccups but is largely as responsive as it needs to be - rounds out the whole picture, creating a polished and truly enjoyable type of stealth gameplay. One which, thankfully, makes up the majority of Chronicles Russia.



However, in place of hand-to-hand (or blade-to-face) combat, here there's an alternative in the form of first-person sniping missions, where you have to take out a base of guards from a nearby rooftop before they notice you or your allies. It's not exactly what you think of when you picture Assassin's Creed, and there isn't much challenge to it, as enemies go down in one shot whether you shoot them in the head or the big toe. Still, this mode actually works surprisingly well, making up for its simplicity by acting as a puzzle the same way the stealth sections do - you can easily drop a guard at a hundred yards, but his buddies may find the body and come after you, which changes the focus of the mission and makes it far more stimulating, not to mention satisfyingly tougher. In addition, Russia’s sniping controls much better than the shooting sections in Chronicles India, making it a fine, if slightly fluffy, addition of variety to the proceedings.



Unfortunately, the whole production loses steam when it comes to timed missions, which feel less like a brilliant free run and more like a painful slog. The game simply goes far out its way to throw too many obstacles into your path. While there's nothing inherently wrong with a challenging course, these sections tend to demand a degree of perfection that quickly gets frustrating - the tenth time you land a jump, but die because you didn't land it in the just the right way, it will grate. Even worse are the timed stealth sections, which tend to fall back on the unfortunate 'wait patiently for the guard to move' style gameplay that Chronicles Russia nearly escaped. When time is also ticking down needlessly, the whole situation feels like a cheap and unpleasant attempt to create tension. Thankfully such moments and their issues are fairly sparsely implemented, so you generally have time to recover before you're forced to deal with that unforgiving set-up again.

This game isn't breaking down any walls. Another iteration on the Chronicles formula, it doesn't do anything shockingly new, and its noticeable drawbacks keep it firmly outside the gates of greatness. But this third attempt succeeds in its own way, taking what the two previous games started and perfecting the formula. If you play just one of the Chronicles games, make it Russia.

The opening level of Lego Avengers is easily one of the worst in all of the Lego franchise. Depicting the opening action sequence of Avengers: Age of Ultron, it’s meant to serve both as tutorial and hype builder, giving you control of each of the titular superheroes in turn as you endeavor to learn how the game works. Hooray, now you’re Thor! And there’s Captain America! Black Widow here to save the day! It’s a sound idea that’s utterly undermined by poor execution, and as a result, it’s a pretty good first indication of how the rest of the game plays out.

Quick primer if you’re not up to date on how Lego games go: you’ll smash bricks, build things, collect studs (the in-game currency) and use tools (both canonical and goofy) to Lego your way through various scenes from the Avenger universe. Each level highlights different characters, each of whom boast different abilities; Tony Stark can fix things, Captain America can put out fires, Hawkeye has a bunch of different arrows, and so on. Hop-in/hop-out co-op lets you team up with a buddy whenever you like, but if you’re on your own you can simply swap between controlled characters to access whatever speciality needs tapping at any given moment. It’s a formula that’s worked exceedingly well in any number of Lego games so far, and while that basic framework is in place in Lego Marvel's Avengers, the result feels phoned in.



On the positive side of the Avengers equation is how the game weaves the many different threads of Avenger hero movies together, such as flashing back to Captain America’s first solo outing when Nick Fury comes to recruit him to defeat Loki. If you’re not a fan of the Marvel Universe - well, honestly, then I don’t know why you’re playing this game because the only pleasure to be gleaned is from appreciation of how Lego Avengers handles its source material - you’ll still be able to follow along and figure out who should be doing what to whom.

On the negative side is...pretty much everything else. Lego Avengers tries to cram too much into too small a space, and as a result, none of it works terribly well. You’ll use the same button to use your character’s special move, execute “finishers” on enemies, and interact with the environment, and in many cases you’ll wind up doing one when you’re trying to do another. The game would’ve been far better off skipping the bonus-raising finishers altogether; they make it a lot easier to rack up the studs you need to achieve Total Avenger rank, but the non-stop respawning enemies you get in exchange simply aren’t worth it. The steady barrage of bad guys is less of a problem if you’re playing with a pal who can keep them off your back,but if you’re on your own, you’re going to die a lot. Trying to find the exact spot you need to be standing in to flip a switch while henchmen are smacking you over and over is aggressively unfun.



SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE HERO

For the most part, Lego Marvel's Avengers uses lines of dialog lifted from the movies to further its plot along, but when that’s not enough, it enlists the aid of Agent Phil Coulson and Peggy Carter to help out. Their sparkling delivery highlights how drab and awkward the rest of the dialog feels. The tone of the Avengers movies is far different from the playfulness of a Lego game, and that disparity shows every time a hero opens their mouth.
Finishing a level is a tedious slog as you force your way from one poorly-designed environment to the next, always kind-of-sort-of knowing what you’re meant to do but being baffled as to how you’re meant to do it. Lego Avengers is terrible at communicating with you - about your objectives, your next destination, whether you’re hitting the right buttons, anything. Epic fight scenes between the likes of Thor and the Hulk are meant to play out like dramatic QTEs, but because neither the button prompts nor the onscreen action ever changes in a significant way, you can’t be sure if you’re impacting the action or not.

Time and exploration are all it usually takes to figure out what needs doing, but too many sections make that nearly impossible by sending an unending series of finishing-move-obsessed enemies at you. You’ll run around and whap buttons and eventually you’ll do the right thing, but the sense of victory that should be yours to claim is shoved aside by the annoyance that’s been building the entire level.



The best Lego games succeed because they maintain a pleasant balance between fun minor characters and the stars of the show, so that you always feel like you’re an important part of the adventure, no matter what minifig you’re controlling. Lego Marvel's Avengers achieves a similar kind of homeostasis, except in this case, all the characters achieve the same relative level of suck. I’m not entirely sure how anyone could turn controlling lightning, shooting lasers from your hands, and flying into soul-sucking chores, but it probably has something to do with a tesseract.



Even when it’s following the plots of the movies from which it takes inspiration, Lego Marvel Avengers feels flat and uninspired, superheroism and Lego collection by numbers. Smash this, build that, listen to jarringly out of place Nick Fury dialog clip, shrug, move on.


This game was reviewed on PS4.

Five teenagers have found the perfect place for their beach party; Edwards Island, which at night is completely deserted and near-impossible to leave. As ideas go, that's up there with inviting Freddy Krueger to your sleepover. Sure enough, it's not long before dark forces crash the party, but this adventure game is at its best when it ignores its horror-trope premise to tell a charming story of teenage friendship and how young people interact with each other.

You play Alex, more of an introvert than a party girl (well, depending on how you play her). She's joined by her new step-brother Jonas, the outsider of the group. Ren, Alex's best friend and the motormouth comic relief – an easy character to get wrong, well executed here thanks to some great lines that the game wisely delivers in short doses. Then there's Nona, a quiet girl who seems to have been invited by Ren just so he can get close to her. Finally there's Clarissa, the sharp-tongued popular girl who makes no effort to hide her disdain for Alex.



These characters could easily be one-note, but Oxenfree shines in its excellent writing and inspired dialogue mechanics. Up to three dialogue options float above you during conversations. You can select one or let them slowly fade out, opting to say nothing at all. The difference here is you're rarely prompted to speak, the conversation happily carrying on without you. These teens will constantly ramble on, forcing you to interrupt if you want to get a word in. It's more realistic (we all have that one friend who won't shut up - if you don't, it's you), forcing you to make Alex more assertive or leave her a borderline silent protagonist. Just like talking in groups in real life, it's up to you how involved you get. But no matter how much or how little you say, the conversation flows naturally. It's the closest we've seen to an actual chat in a game.

The script is rich with great lines, perfectly delivered by its voice cast. Playing Alex as either a pleasant people-pleaser or bitchy bridge-burner results in lots of alternative dialogue and character beats, more than justifying a second playthrough. Say something that resonates with a character, and your face will appear in a thought bubble above them. Whether that's good or bad is left unexplained, leaving you to wonder if you've charmed their socks off, or they're now fantasizing about your murder. Keeping this ambiguous leaves you guessing how you came across, just like after a real awkward encounter. It's a rare game where we wish there was more talking.



When you do shut up, most of Oxenfree's gameplay revolves around Alex's portable radio. After inadvertently triggering mysterious forces, Alex has to use the radio to traverse the island, activating parts of the world and bypassing gates and doors. Disappointingly, this just involves scrolling through numbers on a dial until you feel the controller vibrate. A great opportunity for puzzles becomes a dull, guess-what-number-I'm-thinking-of exercise. Each area has different signals you can tune to, with mysterious messages in Morse code and creepy music that lets you set the ambience of the adventure. It makes the radio a fun gadget, and a clever way to give Edwards Island more character. Just a shame they didn't find smarter uses for it as a puzzle solving tool.

We're glad adventure games no long traffic in the illogical puzzles that once plagued the genre (nightmares about using maple syrup and stolen cat hair to make a false moustache still cause us to wake up screaming), but Oxenfree goes too far the other way, refusing to challenge you at all. Bar a couple of easy riddles, there's nothing here more advanced than 'find the nearby object'. Telltale have sometimes been guilty of oversimplifying the puzzles in their adventure games, but if you can successfully turn on Oxenfree, you're already overqualified to complete it.



The story gets off to a great start, introducing us to its fun cast and setting up the mystery. It's when the island's threat starts revealing itself that the narrative becomes less intriguing. Early moments when the island itself seems to change – with surreal images flashing onscreen, your radio distorting and scratch marks covering the borders, as if you're trapped in a paused VHS tape – these are genuinely unsettling.

But they repeat too often, soon suffering from diminishing returns. When it focuses on the core cast it's far more interesting. The history between Alex and Clarissa is a particular highlight with that inspired dialogue system giving a late game argument real dramatic weight.



It feels like we only got the first two acts of a great story. Just when we're getting to know these characters, it steamrolls towards a conclusion that feels rushed. Because even with character relationships giving it replay value, this is still very short. There are further rewards for searching the island later in the game, but traversal is slow and the island too small to satisfy any explorer's itch. It's also not above some cheap narrative fake-outs, which make it harder to get invested in everyone's fate. One dark moment involving Clarissa should remind us of Life is Strange's best moments, but here feels like it's just used for shock value.

Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India, the second game in Ubisoft's 2.5D platforming mini-series, is the closest thing Assassin's Creed has to a pure stealth title. It doesn't abandon quick movement, but the two can work together well here, with kinetic energy bolstering your covert abilities. If the rest of the game played along, this could have been a welcome shift in tone for fans who prefer to sneak their way to victory. Unfortunately, Chronicles India has a nasty habit of getting in its own way, with finicky controls and an unforgiving level system making much of the adventure feel tedious. It's ultimately the lesser of the two Chronicles games, lacking where Chronicles China stands tall and offering little to make up the difference.


Set in the early years of India's colonial period, Chronicles India comes after the events of the Assassin's Creed Brahman comic, recording the artifact-chasing adventures of Kashmiri Assassin Arbaaz Mir. While some may recognize him as the father of AC Syndicate's bookish Assassin strategist, Henry Green, don't expect to dig deep into the Mir family legacy. A quick peek into the Assassin's Creed universe (at about eight hours long), Chronicles India is distinctly light on story, focusing primarily on Arbaaz's attempts to steal the magical artifact of the week - the Koh-i-Noor diamond, this time.

That's not a big deal if you're coming to Chronicles India primarily for acrobatics or to see how beautiful Assassin's Creed's India is - and it is gorgeous, with boldly-colored landscapes and splashes of Henna-inspired patterns making its finely-crafted artwork pop. However, look for anything heartier in this tale and you'll be disappointed by the time you put the controller down.



To a degree, that seems like the point, as puzzle-solving parkour is clearly Chronicles India's focus. In some ways, that attention pays off - Arbaaz's movements have a natural flow, creating the perceptible smoothness that constant motion should have. That's particularly clear in timed levels when the course allows for true free-running, letting you bound over collapsing platforms or slide beneath toppled pillars just in time to dodge the rampaging elephant on your tail (there had to be at least one). Not surprisingly, these levels are easily the most fun and satisfying of the bunch, though stealth sections that make room for that momentum also benefit - when you can whistle at one window, slide through the one next to it, and steal a precious artifact from right under a guard's nose, the Smooth Criminal jokes flow.

Sadly, Chronicles India tries far too often to slow your progress. While stopping to consider how to get past a pack of guards is perfectly fine, sentinels are often positioned in such a way that you have to hunker down while you wait for them to clear the only available path, cutting off the game's precious momentum. Because Chronicles India doesn't rely on the heart-pounding tension of almost getting caught that most stealth games do, cooling your heels drains you of nervous energy instead of ramping it up, so these sequences feel like unnecessary roadblocks rather than challenges to be overcome. Not all of the stealthy portions bring you to a grinding halt this way (some actually encourage you to use your speed to dodge past obstacles and guards), but knowing the game can do better makes these sequences stick out even more. The worst, however, are puzzles that force you to wait on giant shifting platforms, often plopped down in the middle of timed sections, creating an artificial means of slowing you down when that should not be happening.



It's also in these sections where the otherwise fine controls start causing problems. Trying to assassinate your target from a ledge is a pain when Arbaaz jumps instead of hanging, and getting killed when he only attacks one target after you painstakingly set up a double-assassination is the stuff deep sighs are made of. While there is an improvement over the controls in Chronicles China (I never got stuck because Arbaaz couldn't climb from the ceiling to the wall), the issues that remain aren't any less frustrating.

That, however, isn't Chronicles India's biggest flaw - that honor belongs to its combat, and uncertainty about how brawling should figure into the action. Most of the time the game discourages fights outright, giving you so little health you can be killed by a single shotgun blast even in late sections of the game. Plus, while your level score is based on how well you perform in one of three stealth-based categories (Shadow if you're never seen and kill no one; Assassin if you're never seen but do kill; and Silencer if you're never seen and choose to knock your victims out instead), being spotted by a guard or getting into a fight automatically kicks you down to the lowest possible score in the Shadow category. That isn't the case in timed sections, where your score is based on how fast you finish, but in every other situation fighting means an instant downgrade.



While that wouldn't be a big deal if high scores were treated as optional, the upgrades you get for a stellar performance are so critical to future missions that it's difficult to proceed without them; you're not so much rewarded for a job well done as punished for anything less, so getting into fights is akin to failure. That can mean repeating missions over and over until you can do them without being spotted, which quickly becomes a tedious exercise. That is, until the game wants to push you into a fight, which feels so counterintuitive to everything else you've done that it's hard to enjoy.


This game was reviewed on Xbox One.

Street Fighter 5 wants you to have fun. It is fully aware of just how much giddy, gratifying, intelligent, enriching enjoyment it contains, and its primary instinct is to deliver that to you, as quickly and directly as possible, at whatever level you want to play.

Whichever end of the fighting game skill spectrum you currently stand on, do not take that to mean that Street Fighter 5 has been dumbed down. Hardcore, high-level players will find a vast amount of depth, nuance, and long-term malleability in its bold, immediate systems. And the less expert have a very long and exhilarating road of growth, improvement, learning and discovery ahead of them. The difference this time is that the clarity of Street Fighter 5’s systems and presentation has been tuned to near perfection.


Before a single punch has even been thrown, Street Fighter 5’s disdain for overly complex barriers is obvious. Gone is Street Fighter 4’s Focus Attack system, most crucially. The mechanic was intended as a get-out-of-jail free card in hairy situations, allowing hits to be safely absorbed and counter-attacked, but its secondary use as the primary means of setting up SF4’s most powerful, showboating combos ultimately gated away the fun of the higher-end game from all but the most dedicated and dexterous. In its place – literally, activated by the same, simple two-button press – is the V-Skill. Or rather, the many V-Skills. Because instead of bottlenecking creative play via a very specific route, a la its predecessor, the V system initiates the open, utterly freeform, ‘anything can happen’ play that Street Fighter 5 revels in.

Tap both medium attack buttons together, and your character will instantly perform a special move or attack unique to them. No stick or pad waggling required. And I do mean unique. These things are simple, but immensely powerful game-changers. Zangief, for example, can absorb damage in a similar fashion to the old Focus, but he can also do so while advancing, radically reversing the glacial grappler’s old problem with getting into attack range. Chun-Li will launch into the air at odd angles, throwing off opponents used to her normal trajectories. M. Bison can grab fireballs out of the air and hurl them straight back. Ryu gains the ability to safely parry (and retaliate against) as many incoming hits as you can nail the timing for.

Holding out for Super Hyper Ultra Street Fighter 5: Turbo Wonder Edition? Don't. There will be no traditional expansions this time. Instead, Street Fighter 5's additional characters will be drip-fed into the roster as incremental updates. And in theory, you won't have to pay for any of them. In-game currency - known as Fight Money - will cover the cost, if you've earned enough. But of course, real cash will also suffice if you don't want to wait.
If you need an example of how fundamental an addition the V-Skills are, it’s all there in that last one, which rips out one of Street Fighter 3’s core systems wholesale, and hands it to just one character on the roster. Asymmetry is Street Fighter 5’s thing, you see. Asymmetry, and unpredictability, and dynamism, and creativity. The basics of attack, evasion, controlling space and stringing together combos come packing enough flexibility to keep you going and growing for months – and probably years - but when you want to crank up both the flashiness and the fun, the tools to do so are a simple button tap away.

The same goes the second part of the V system: the V-Trigger. Here, you simply need to hit the two strong attack buttons at the same time, and your character will enter a special, time-limited, powered up state which changes their fighting properties – furnishing, say, multi-hitting attacks, or greater speed or defense - or even gives them new special moves. Karin’s suite of charging-punches, block-breaking overhead hits, and defensive back-dashes is a particularly potent example. Yet more power, yet more options, yet still a minimum of challenge in execution. The various building blocks of Street Fighter 5’s strategic game are simple to grasp and simple to use, but they click together to build systems of immense power and versatility. It all creates the feel of a game that doesn’t want to present any hurdles to your progress, but which rather wants to give you all of its tools up front, and let you get on with building your own fun straight away.



And whatever level you start playing at, you will achieve that. Because all of these systems come alongside a core fighting set-up with clarity at its absolute centre. Control is immediate and flowing, with special move inputs noticeably stripped back for simplicity, quarter-circles very much ruling the roost these days. With combo timings more forgiving than ever, and a fantastic clarity of visual feedback running through every hit, block, and counter, it’s as easy to grasp the logic and strategy of Street Fighter 5 as it is to start having fun straight out of the gate.

The perfect fighting game then? Unfortunately no. Because there’s a rather frustrating irony in Street Fighter 5’s launch day set-up. You see, while the core game is a wonderful, player-minded blend of immediate enjoyment and friendly, long-term lessons, the current content array does not get that across terribly well. Not for the solitary player, anyway. While couch-based vs. play against another human will always be the best way to enjoy a fighter, in these post-Mortal Kombat X days, a strong, inventive suite of solo options is a must-have in terms of easing a player in. And Street Fighter 5, currently at least, does not have one.



Get past the baffling lack of a traditional arcade mode, and you’ll find only Story and Survival set-ups, alongside an unguided training mode featuring customisable AI. Story initially seems promising, but ultimately feels like a half-baked afterthought, delivering only two to four, challenge-free, single-round fights per character, strung together with rather cheap-looking and uneventful motion comics. A proper, cutscene-driven narrative campaign is coming as a free update, and will hopefully rival the later MK games’ fun and engaging equivalents – Street Fighter certainly has the personality to make the idea sing – but it’s only landing in June, which may be too late for players without an immediate crew of fight buddies.

Also coming later – March, this time – is Challenge mode, which should provide a decent training facility alongside the (seemingly now requisite) daily tasks, but being unavailable in the review build, it’s currently impossible to quantify either way. Its arrival isn’t too far off, but again, a very important part of the single-player offering is missing at launch.



This inevitably brings us to the realm of online play, in which findings have been decidedly mixed. When it works, it works very well, fights playing out as well as in a local bout. But in pre-release play, those kinds of results have only appeared about half of the time, the remainder taking in the full gamut of online performance from ‘slightly gluey’ to ‘full-blown slide-show’. Hopefully netcode will be improved over time, but once again we have an area of SF5 where underperformance pushes local vs. play as the only real, consistently viable option.

Firewatch is one of the most enthralling slices of entertainment I've ever experienced. For 5-6 hours you'll walk in the hiking boots of Henry, a likeable, slightly chubby man-with-a-beard in his late-30s. After a devastating, tragic development in his family life, Henry takes a job as a fire ranger in Wyoming, with the intention of sitting in a tower all summer, ostensibly watching for wildfires, but really pondering his next move in life. But thanks to the first-person viewpoint and multiple-choice dialogue options, it all feels like it's happening to you. And my goodness, how it sucked me in.

The whole point of Henry taking the job was to be alone with his thoughts, but there's very little of that. Instead, you're in constant radio contact with his boss – a lady in her early 40s named Delilah, and the two of you develop a rapport over the days and months of the summer. I'm not going to spoil the rest of the plot for you because it's something you need to experience for yourself. But I can at least tell you why it's so good.


The conversational dialogue between Henry and Delilah is brilliantly acted, certainly some of the best voicing I've ever heard in a game. There are some funny, goofy jokes which fit Henry's personality brilliantly, and the selection of responses have enough variety to make you feel like you're affecting the direction of the game, even if the outcome is carefully curated in order to maintain control of what you'll feel at any one time.

And you really will feel things. I don't mean that in a boring 'artsy indie game' kind of way. I mean proper nervousness, fear, intrigue and the best treatment of paranoia in any game ever. Is it justified? Well that would be telling. Suffice to say the sense of isolation in this middle-of-nowhere valley dials up all of these emotions past normal gaming levels and into genuine unease.



TURT REYNOLDS?

There's a turtle that you can adopt and name - I chose Turt Reynolds from the list of options because of course anyone would. I actually found two of them, which did live in the same box in the watchtower, but whether there are any more (or if you're supposed to find more than one) remains to be seen.
This is augmented by the sound design, which is superb. Beautiful incidental music kicks in when it's needed, adding immensely to the atmosphere and timeless nowhereness of this sun-baked valley. The team had some fun making the duck noises by the lake as I'm certain some of them are played for laughs, but subtle but deliberate sounds like rustles in the undergrowth panned hard left or right in the stereo mix will ring out like alarm bells in your head. Your senses will be heightened while you play Firewatch.

Naturally I was very disappointed to discover three (just three in the whole game) instances of poor continuity (two in the same area), where dialogue either repeated or introduced an object that had already been established and discussed. That sort of thing absolutely shatters the illusion of reality the game spends so long building up, but at least it is very, very rare. Mostly it's exemplary, and no mean feat considering the multiple dialogue options.



Hiking through lush, stylised vegetation, using only a map and a compass for navigation, you'll find that some paths are blocked with brambles or fallen bridges, and you get to access those later as you find new equipment. It's Metroidvania, of course, and probably the most videogamey element of the whole experience. But such elements of game design are a little too apparent.

The game is also surprisingly linear, funneling you towards specific points with a sense of urgency that means it doesn't feel right to stand around and admire the scenery. There are often two routes to whatever location you're meant to reach next, but you can't really deviate from them, resulting in a surprisingly small-feeling game that never really feels as big as the area it gives you to run around in. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but this is definitely a story-driven game, not an open-world sandbox.



Sadly there are some small problems to spoil what is otherwise an incredible experience. Technically, the PS4 version I played is sketchy, with stutters and pauses akin to those found in Oblivion as you moved from one area of scenery to another. The frame-rate's super smooth if you're looking at the sky, but it's noticeably inconsistent. Never a flickerbook, but not as slick as it could or should have been.

Some grass hovers above the ground, I found a weird teleportation bug, incorrect note text screens for the object I was holding, and suffered a load crash – all on finished code. Tiny gnats in the ointment, but gnats nonetheless. Also, while I appreciate I'll be in the minority with this particular view, while the art style is undoubtedly gorgeous, it might arguably have benefited from being more naturalistic (like Rise of the Tomb Raider's forest sections) to complement the realism of the audio. It's a tad cartoony. And at one point I even wondered if Henry was supposed to be tripping because everything was so… red. He wasn't. It was just red.
