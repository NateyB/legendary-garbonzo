in the player training screens without dropping to the main menu after every contest but credit has to be given for speeding the game up so dramatically Road to the Show is much more enjoyable now especially with position players where you generally see only a handful of at bats on base appearances and fielding attempts each game I was able to zip through months of play with my third baseman alter ego in just a couple of sittings this year something that was previously impossible due to constant menu interruptions and lengthy delays for loading and saving ShowTime has almost as much of an impact on Road to the Show gameplay Basically this is a control gimmick that works like a baseball centric take on bullet time Hold R when hitting running the bases or fielding and everything slows down to give you more time to zone in You can? t use this endlessly as there is a meter keeping you somewhat honest here But even still this is a pretty blatant cheat that is hard to line up with the realistic nature of the rest of the game I actually felt guilty when using ShowTime although the abrupt transition to slo mo actually tended to hurt me more than it helped It made fielding attempts erratic and got in the way of the rhythm of at bats I still tried to use it on occasion when hitting in key moments though The cool factor of being able to slow down pitches to the point where I felt like this must have been how a guy like Willie Keeler saw the ball was an undeniable lure especially in key moments with runners on base Perks are linked to special bonuses that can be used in Road to the Show games to buff abilities at the cost of portions of your ShowTime meter Some are consumed instantly others last for full games You can use a perk to force a pitcher to throw nothing but fastballs in an at bat for instance or to start every at bat up or even get the benefit of starting with a count with the bases loaded There seems to be a perk for just about every situation imaginable You can even make an enemy runner try to steal Animations lighting effects and stadiums details combine to present truly gorgeous scenes in MLB The Show I? m torn about both ShowTime and Perks I like them for the added spice they provide and can see the appeal of using them to liven up long seasons ShowTime can be seen as a way of depicting the preternatural vision of great hitters as noted above and Perks can represent things like mind games getting into the head of opponents or a player? s reputation and a tough situation forcing favorable counts Of course the baseball purist in me finds all of this somewhat fraudulent All I can say here is that you? re not forced to use either feature and can safely ignore them if you want to keep things real Bowman Scout Day is another new Road to the Show feature Here you show off for assembled scouts going through various on field drills to prove that you? re worthy of a high draft pick The end result is a full scouting report just like the one provided to real wannabe big leaguers It? s a little too much of an all or nothing exercise especially given that you? re put on the spot without the benefit of say
similar single player game might be Wild desperate shooting usually leads to a quick death forcing you to learn the ins and outs of your ship and load out during the game s early stages The variety of weapons is a big draw There s the standard array of quick firing lasers missiles and other familiar sci fi shooter mainstays but as things progress newer ships and options offer impressively strategic and creative slower firing weapons huge energy balls that roll forward through space surrounded by clouds of destructive power and other big risk big reward weapons of mass destruction There are AI drones that will follow and orbit your ship to provide extra support as well and each ship offers myriad upgrade options Dead Star features three different development tracks for ships with a fourth on the way each focused on a specific alien race Within each track are three ship types offering distinctly different play experiences The Scouts are fast and maneuverable but light on firepower Raiders are slower but offer great attack potential For tank lovers the frigate class vessels offer size and potentially immense destructive power but their large size and slow speed means they need a lot of support Prepare for battle Each line of ships has a distinct look and weapon style but as expected in multiplayer games don? t differ enough from their alien counterparts to create gameplay imbalances In addition to pure ship on ship action the landscapes sport their own set of dangers and opportunities The Dead Star system is a battlefield graveyard full of dead ships and the burnt leftovers of destroyed planets Giant tunneled out rocks float through space allowing players to hide and discover ore deposits Smaller obstacles need to be avoided which can be challenging in the heat of combat Mine ore is traded at home bases for currency that allows for ship upgrades and players also earn upgrades through level progression This gives Dead Star a solid sense of continuity without being a completely persistent world and this sense of forward momentum is vital to the experience In the standard Conquest mode two teams fight to take over specific AI controlled base stations When one team conquers the whole sector they win Its simple to get into and allows for a wide range of play styles Players who just want to fly around and blow things up will be just as at home as those who prefer to tactically take over real estate and provide support Get far enough in Conquest mode and the Escape Run mode will unlock which plays directly into Dead Star s overall plot It seems that the system? s sun is about to literally die? it could go supernova any time destroying everything in its path So the inmates are in a fervor to find a leftover capital ship from the old war and warp out of there Escape Run lets a team of four commandeer a capital ship and attempt to make it through multiple sectors to reach a jump point thus winning the match The gimmick is that those sectors are actually other Conquest games in progress When
you? ll go through a living door only to find it? s still connected to an actual creature? some huge worm like thing that produces foul toxic gas The whole world of Severed is full of strange sights that make it worthwhile to comb every inch of its multi level maps Severed starts out deceptively simplistic and bizarre The weird old school scrolling method and touch based interactions hide a remarkably deep and involving mix of action adventure and role playing The more hours you pour into Severed the more complex it becomes and the darker the story gets It takes a while to grasp but once the game picks up steam it becomes an intriguing experience that s unlike any other game on Vita to date At times I can t help but marvel at Ashes of the Singularity Watching a battlefield gradually pack in thousands of hover tanks and carriers as supply lines stretch and groan to support massive war efforts is intoxicating There s a wonderment here that begs you to grasp at what commanding a continent spanning conflict might feel like At that scale the subtle movements of fighter squadrons and the flashes of canon fire yield to larger vistas and you can feel the game s pulse as wave after wave of enemies cascade across your screen Impressive though it may be peeling away the lustrous exterior reveals that Ashes of the Singularity is a surprisingly hollow game with few novel ideas to support its scale It plays like many of its peers you build out a base collect resources and engage in combat It s a basic framework that underpins everything from Starcraft to Rise of Nations The core problem is there is little to appreciate beyond how busy Ashes of the Singularity s battles become When it comes to forming a strategy there are few opportunities to develop nuanced tactics You have three main resources to manage metal radiactives and turinium The first two are for constructing ships but if you collect enough turinium you win the game Because turinium is necessary for victory Ashes of the Singularity encourages hapless and aggressive rushing Your starting area will only have a couple resource nodes and you can t stockpile resources as you can in most other strategy games So playing cautiously isn t an option You have to expand and fast This exacerbates some of Ashes of the Singularity s other problems As I churned out endless streams of robotic warriors I noticed that they all looked similar especially when I pulled the camera all the way out and the battlefield melted together in the m? lange of war machines Pressing to gain more and more ground kept me from developing any familiarity with my units which is unfortunate given you only have about a dozen unique types to work with Each frigate looks indistinguishable from the last making it hard to keep track of which units you have and which ones you still need Maps are consistently dry and lack character With the exception of modest changes in elevation there aren t many features that lend themselves to strategic use There are no towering mountains to hide
first You can either scan for better drop locations or take what you see But if you wait another company can claim vital real estate before you and you may find yourself with precious few options for critical resources later in the game Every moment from that initial decision until the final stock purchase is incredible I haven t even scratched the surface of all that you can do here It s a bit chilling to think that in Offworld you re playing out the same obsessive pursuit of capitalism that led to the fall of its finctional Earth an event hinted at in tutorial dialogue yet it s so recklessly entertaining and biting with its satire that I couldn? t help but get lost When combined with truly deep and intricate strategic options Offworld is a revelation It s almost unparalleled in the genre Each and every game is thrilling Every moment is a challenge And the brutality of the free market ensures that you can never rest on your laurels less you be quashed by the invisible hand The latest Reviews from GameSpot The second episode of Hitman opens with Agent lounging on a bench in the idyllic vacation destination Sapienza With a newspaper in hand and a crisp Italian shirt on his back you could be forgiven for mistaking Agent as a proxy of Daniel Craig s James Bond if it wasn t for his shaved ba Sapienza s laid back atmosphere is almost the antithesis of the first episode s bustling fashion show and this shift comes as a breath of fresh air There s a greater variety of events to behold and more ground to cover and you re afforded more opportunities to explore unfettered by potential threats on the streets While familiarizing yourself with the area you ll regularly stumble into amusing scenes and personalities Whether it s a street performer entertaining a group of tourists an off duty waiter taking a leak or a priest who s flustered to see you barge into the middle of a confession there are numerous vignettes that made me snicker and buy into the idea that Sapienza is a functioning community It s disappointing that you can t enter every building given the potential advantages and entertainment they could provide but episode two s world feels intricate and alive It didn t take long for me to warm up to the sunlit streets and coastal views which provided a relaxing buffer from this episode s dangerous destination a mansion with a secret underground laboratory protected by mafia like guards and professional security Your mission is to infiltrate the home kill two targets and destroy an experimental virus located in the heart of the lab In traditional Hitman fashion there are disguises to steal from unsuspecting NPCs that allow you to pass through security checkpoints and
