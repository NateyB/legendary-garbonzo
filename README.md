CS 7313: Advanced Artificial Intelligence

All of the projects from my Advanced AI class at the University of Tulsa, wonderfully preserved (except the broken ones)
in the hopes that one day they will fly on their own. Presently, I plan to update them periodically as I become a better
programmer and gain more knowledge (particularly in the languages that I do not know very well).
